# Main Ideas of Machine Learning

Machine learning uses algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships from given data (training data), with
the goal of making quantitative predictions (regression) or identifying structures to then classify the data.

<Callout type="example">

We have a lot of data on houses, including their, size, location, number of rooms, etc. the so called features of
our data. We can then use this data, machine learning and a given target variable (sometimes also called label) in this
case the price to predict the price of a new house given its features.

Machine learning also has a lot of other applications such as clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.

## Data

In machine learning, data is typically split into three different subsets: training data, validation data, and test data.

The training data is used to train the machine learning model to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable.
Features can be of different shapes, for example numerical, categorical, or text-based, and so can the target variable
depending on the model's goal. In the case of a house price it would be a continuous numerical value. But if we wanted to
classify the house on whether it is expensive or not, the target variable would be a binary value.

The model is trained by using an algorithm to adjust its parameters to minimize the difference between its
predicted output and the actual target values in the training data. This process is often referred to as "fitting" the
model to the training data.

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on the validation data to determine how well it can generalize to new, unseen
data. The validation data is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, which are parameters that are not learned
from the training data but are set before training begins.

After the hyperparameters have been tuned using the validation data, the model is tested on the test data to get an
unbiased estimate of its performance. The test data should be representative of the data that the model will encounter
in the real world, and it should be completely independent of the training and validation data to avoid bias.
