# Traversing a Binary Tree

There are multiple ways to traverse a tree each one giving a different result.

## Pre-order, NLR

In this order a node visited before its left and right subtree is traversed.

1. Visit the current node.
2. Recursively traverse the current node's left subtree.
3. Recursively traverse the current node's right subtree.

## Post-order, LRN

In this order a node is visited after its left and right subtree has been traversed.

1. Recursively traverse the current node's left subtree.
2. Recursively traverse the current node's right subtree.
3. Visit the current node.

## In-order, LNR

In this order a node is visited in between the traversal of its left and right subtree.

1. Recursively traverse the current node's left subtree.
2. Visit the current node.
3. Recursively traverse the current node's right subtree.
