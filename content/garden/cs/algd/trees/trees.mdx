# What is a Tree?

In Computer science a tree is a data structure that is used to represent a hierarchical structure within a set of elements.
A tree consists of node that are connected by edges. Each node has a corresponding value, the so called **key**.
This concept might sound familiar because it is similar to a graph. However, in a tree:
- All nodes are connected by edges, making a tree a connected graph, so there no isolated nodes.
- The tree has a hierarchical structure where one node, the root, serves as the starting point. The root has no parent 
nodes and all other nodes have exactly one parent node. This is why are also often called a **rooted tree**.

In most visualizations the root is at the top and the children are below it, creating the hierarchical tree like structure. 

Because each node only has one parent, **there is always exactly one path from one node to another node**. This is why 
trees are acyclic, meaning there are **no cycles in the tree**. If there were two different paths from one node to another
there would be a cycle in the graph and the hierarchical structure would be lost. 

Therefore any graph that is connected and acyclic is a tree. A forest is a collection of trees so any graph that is acyclic as each connected component is a tree.

In trees there are a few relationships between nodes that are important to know:
- **Root:** We have already seen that just like in the real world a tree always has a root. This 
is the node at the top of the tree and is the only node that has no parent.
- **Children & Parents:** A child node is a node that is connected to a node above it, the so called parent. 
- **Ancestors:** If we follow the path from a node to the root we get all the ancestors of that node.
- **Descendants:** If we follow the path from a node to all its children and their children we get all the descendants of that node.
- **Siblings:** Just like in the real world a sibling is a node that shares the same parent. 
- **Subtrees:** If we focus on a specific node and look at all of its children and their children (the nodes descendants) we get a subtree. 
- **Leaves**: Just like in the real world a leaf is a node that just hangs there with nothing below it, i.e 
a node that has no children. 
- **Inner nodes:** All other nodes that are not leaves and have at least one child are called inner nodes.

Apart from relationships between nodes there are also some important properties of trees that are important to know: 
- **Order:** The order of a tree is the maximum amount of children a node can have. In the tree above we don't know the 
order of the tree but we can say that it is greater or equal to 3.
- **Height:** The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. In the above tree the height is 5.
- **Depth:** The depth of a node is very similar to the height but is the length of the path from the root to that specific node. 
It is often denoted as $\text{depth}(v)$. So in the above tree $\text{depth}(L)=4$.
- **Level:** A level is a grouping of all nodes with the same depth. So the number of levels is the height of the tree.

## Full and Complete Trees

Lastly there are a few special types of trees that are important to know about:
- **Full tree:** Is a tree where all inner nodes have the maximum amount of Nodes according to the order.
So a node has either 0 or the maximum amount of children. In the image below both trees are full with an order of 2.
- **Complete tree:** Is a tree where each level has the maximum amount of nodes according to the order. 
So there are no gaps in the tree. A complete tree is always full but a full tree is not always complete.
In the image below only the left tree is complete with an order of 2.

## Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree of order 2. Meaning that each node can have at most 2 children.
This results in either being the root, a leaf or the left or right child.

By adding empty leaves (marked as squares) we can make sure the binary tree is always filled, so each node has 2 children. 
This adaption can make certain operations and algorithms apparently easier. However, I personally haven't 
seen this in practice. We add the empty leaves by first adding 2 empty leaves to all leaves which makes the leaves 
now inner nodes. Then all inner nodes that only have one child receive an empty leaf.
