# Jump Game

A popular problem in dynamic programming is the jump game problem. The problem is from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/) and 
is defined as follows:

> You are given an Array $A$ containing non-negative integers where $A[i]$ denotes the maximum number of steps you can take from index $i$. You 
> start at index 0 and you need to reach the last index of the array. Determine if you can reach the last index.

Need to do this for the normal jump game problem

brute force is n^n, with memoization it is n^2 and with greedy bottom up it is n the greedy idea 
comes from the fact that we change end position to the current position if we can reach the end position

## Minimum Number of Jumps

The problem can also be changed to rather then just determining if you can reach the last index, determine the minimum number of jumps needed to 
reach the last index. This problem is also from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/). There is a youtube video that explains the 
problem and some solutions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ7sWiOoK7g). 

<Callout type="todo">
Greedy solution is something like a BFS.
</Callout>

An initial idea would be to solve the subproblem of "What is the minimum number of jumps needed to reach index $i$?" and then use this to solve the 
problem of "What is the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index?". So we would define the recursion as follows:

```math
\text{minJumps}(i) = \min \{1 + \text{minJumps}(j) \mid 1 \leq j \leq i \land j + A[j] \geq i\}
```

So for each $i$ we would check all the previous indices and see if we can reach $i$ from that index. If we can then we would take the minimum 
number of jumps needed to reach that index and add 1 to it. This results in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

```java
int minJumps(int[] A) {
    int n = A.length;
    int[] dp = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (j + A[j] >= i) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[j]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n-1];
}
```

This is already polynomial but we can do better. Having to look at all previous indices seems like a waste of time. Instead we could store in our DP 
table at index $i$ the maximum index we can reach with $i$ jumps. This way we just need to check if the last index is reachable. The dp table would 
still be the same size as the worst case is when the array only contains 1's and we would need to jump to each index. So we would define the recursion 
as follows:

```math
\text{maxIndex}(i) = \max \{j + A[j] \mid 0 \leq j \leq \text{maxIndex}(i-1)\}
```

```java
int minJumps(int[] A) {
    int n = A.length;
    int j = 0;
    int[] dp = new int[n];
    dp[0] = 0;
    // until we can reach the last index
    while (dp[j] < n - 1) {
        j++;
        int maxIndex = dp[j-1];
        // find the maximum index we can reach with j jumps
        for (int i = 0; i <= maxIndex; i++) {
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], i + A[i]);
        }
    }
    return j;
}
```

This still unfortunately results in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ as we have to check all previous indices for each jump to find the maximum index. We can 
slightly improve this by changing the lower bound to be looked at from $0$ to $i-2$ as we know that we can always reach index $i-2$ with $i-2$ jumps. So 
we then just need to look at $dp[i-1] - dp[i-2]$ elements which results in a time complexity of $O(n)$.

```java
int minJumps(int[] A) {
    int n = A.length;
    int j = 0;
    // need to initialize to -1 as we are looking at i-2
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 0;
    while (dp[j] < n - 1) {
        j++;
        int maxIndex = dp[j-1];
        // we can start at dp[j-2] as we know we can reach dp[j-2] with j-2 jumps
        for (int i = dp[j-2]; i <= maxIndex; i++) {
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], i + A[i]);
        }
    }
    return j;
}
