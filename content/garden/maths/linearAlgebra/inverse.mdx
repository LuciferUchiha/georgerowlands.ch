# Matrix inverse

must be square

must be full rank otherwise only a left inverse or right inverse

definition without how to get it.

It is generally true for two mxm matrices A and B that AB = I implies BA = I? How good does generally mean. This then means inverse of A is B and vice versa.

Derive formulas for 1x1 and 2x2 case

Show that the inverse is unique.

Derive (AB)^-1 using linear transoformations?

inverse of transpose is transpose of inverse?

Inverse theorem: If A is invertable then the columns are linearly independent and the rows are linearly independent, so we have full rank, for every Ax=b there is a unique solution x = A^-1b, and the inverse is unique.
