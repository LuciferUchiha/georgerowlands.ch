# SVD - Singular Value Decomposition

The eigendecomposition only works for square matrices, the singular value decomposition, short SVD, is a generalization of the eigendecomposition allowing it to be used for rectangular matrices. Singular value decomposition uses 3 matrices just like the eigendecomposition.

```math
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{U}\Sigma\mathbf{V}^T
```

The first matrix $\mathbf{U}$ is the so-called left singular value matrix which is an orthogonal matrix meaning $\mathbf{UU}^T=\mathbf{I}$, the second matrix $\Sigma$ is the singular value matrix which is very just like the matrix containing the eigenvalues in the eigendecomposition a diagonal matrix. The last matrix $\mathbf{V}^T$ is the right singular value matrix which is also an orthogonal matrix. To find the values we can do the following transformations which make it very similar to the eigendecomposition.

```math
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{V}\Sigma^T\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{U}\Sigma\mathbf{V}^T \\
    \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{V}(\Sigma^T\Sigma)\mathbf{V}^T
\end{align*}
```

Because $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix the multiplication with its transpose results again in a diagonal matrix. Which gives it the same form as the eigendecomposition. To get the matrix $\mathbf{U}$ we can do something very similar.

```math
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^T=\mathbf{U}\Sigma\mathbf{V}^T\mathbf{V}\Sigma^T\mathbf{U}^T \\
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^T=\mathbf{U}(\Sigma\Sigma^T)\mathbf{U}^T
\end{align*}
```



```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[-5,2,3], [2, 5, 1], [-3,1,-5]])
e_values, e_vectors = np.linalg.eigh(A.T@A) # @ is same as np.matmul
Sigma = np.diag(np.sqrt(e_values))
V = e_vectors
U = []
for i in range(0, len(e_values)):
    u_i = A@V[:,i]/np.linalg.norm(A@V[:,i])
    U.append(u_i)
U@Sigma@V.T
```
<div className="code-output-wrapper">
```
    array([[-5.18214154,  1.89367286,  2.74943852],
           [ 1.95955405,  5.01675209,  1.2880268 ],
           [-2.7028794 ,  1.11633398, -5.07755598]])
```
</div>

We can see that we lose some precision due to floating number operations but these can be fixed using the round operation.


```python
np.round(U@Sigma@V.T)
```
<div className="code-output-wrapper">
```
    array([[-5.,  2.,  3.],
           [ 2.,  5.,  1.],
           [-3.,  1., -5.]])
```
</div>

We can also just use the built in svd of numpy which is more efficient and accurate.


```python
U, Sigma, Vh = np.linalg.svd(A)
U@np.diag(Sigma)@Vh
```
<div className="code-output-wrapper">
```
    array([[-5.,  2.,  3.],
           [ 2.,  5.,  1.],
           [-3.,  1., -5.]])
```
</div>


Solving equations using svd???? Or only because we can solve equations using moore penrose and one way to compute is with SVD.
