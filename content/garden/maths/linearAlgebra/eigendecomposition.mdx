# Eigendecomposition

Before introducing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, let's first remind ourselves how vectors can be transformed by matrices. A matrix can rotate, scale, or otherwise change a vector. For example we can rotate a vector using the rotation matrix:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
  \sin\theta &  \cos\theta \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
  x \\
  y \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  x' \\
  y' \\
\end{bmatrix}
```

Or we can use a matrix to scale a vector:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 0 \\
  0 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
  4 \\
  3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  8 \\
  6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
```

Now, let's dive into the core idea of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. An eigenvector of a square matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbf{R}^{n \times n}$ is a special vector whose direction remains unchanged when the matrix is applied to it. So the matrix only scales the vector by a scalar $\lambda$, which is called the eigenvalue. For a square matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, an eigenvalue $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ is a scalar such that:

```math
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
```

where $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ is the so called eigenvector. This can be rewritten as:

```math
(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}
```

A trivial solution to this equation would be where we have the eigenvector $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{o}$, as any matrix multiplied by the zero vector is the zero vector and we could choose any $\lambda$. However, we are looking for non-trivial solutions, so we want to find non-zero vectors $\mathbf{v}$ that satisfy the equation above. Impportantly the eigenvalue $\lambda$ and the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ can be complex, we will later see why this is the case but is due to the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots in $\mathbb{C}$, so we can always find complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors but not necessarily real ones.

## Characteristic Polynomial

We notice from the equation above that the eigenvector is in the nullspace of the matrix $\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$. And because we are looking for non-zero trivial solutions this means that the nullspace of the matrix $\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$ can not just be the zero vector. This then also means that the matrix $\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$ is not invertible. We know that a matrix is not invertible if the determinant is zero. So we can find the eigenvalues by solving the equation:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0
```

This is called the characteristic equation/polynomial of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. For a simple $2 \times 2$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the characteristic polynomial is:

```math
P(\lambda) = \text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix} - \lambda \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
a - \lambda & b \\
c & d - \lambda
\end{bmatrix}
```

Using the determinant formula for a $2 \times 2$ matrix, we can expand this to:

```math
\begin{align*}
det(\mathbf{A}) &= ad - bc \\ 
P(\lambda) &= det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) \\
&= (a - \lambda)(d - \lambda) - bc \\ 
&= \lambda^2 - (a + d)\lambda + (ad - bc) 
```

So we can see that the characteristic polynomial is a quadratic polynomial in $\lambda$. If we also consider the case of a $3 \times 3$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, the characteristic polynomial becomes a cubic polynomial:

```math
P(\lambda) = \text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i
\end{bmatrix} - \lambda \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
a - \lambda & b & c \\
d & e - \lambda & f \\
g & h & i - \lambda
\end{bmatrix}
```

using the determinant formula for a $3 \times 3$ matrix, we can expand this to:

```math
\begin{align*}
det(\mathbf{A}) = aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh \\
P(\lambda) &= det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) \\
&= (a - \lambda)(e - \lambda)(i - \lambda) + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh \\
&= (a - \lambda)(e - \lambda)(i - \lambda) + bfg + cdh - c(e - \lambda)g - bd(i - \lambda) - (a - \lambda)fh \\
&= - \lambda^3 + \ldots
```

Because the determinant involves products of $n$ terms, the characteristic polynomial is a degree-$n$ polynomial and due to the structure of the determinant the leading coefficient of $\lambda^n$ is $(-1)^n$. This follows from the fact that we always subtract $\lambda$ from the diagonal elements of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, and we end up mulitply this factor by itself $n$ times, multiplying a negative number an even number of times results in a positive number, and multiplying a negative number an odd number of times results in a negative number, hence the leading coefficient is $(-1)^n$. The other coefficients $c_{n-1}, \dots, c_0$ are determined by the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. This leads us the general form of the characteristic polynomial for an $n \times n$ matrix:

```math
P(\lambda) = (-1)^n \lambda^n + c_{n-1} \lambda^{n-1} + \dots + c_1 \lambda + c_0
```

Before talking more about the characteristic polynomial, let's first introduce the fundamental theorem of algebra. The theorem states that for any polynomial of degree $n \geq 1$:

```math
P(z) = c_n z^n + c_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \dots + c_0
```

where $c_n \neq 0$ and $z \in \mathbb{C}$, there exist exactly $n$ roots in $\mathbb{C}$, so $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $P(z_n) = 0$. Importantly these roots can be real, complex or repeated. For example the following example has two complex roots:

```math
P(z) = z^2 + 1 = 0 \implies z^2 = -1 \implies z = i, -i
```

where $i$ is the imaginary unit. These roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ which we are trying to find by solving the characteristic polynomial $P(\lambda) = 0$. So the eigenvalues of a matrix can be complex numbers. 

We know that when we are trying to solve a polynomial equation, one way to find the roots is to factorize the polynomial. We can then directly read of the roots from the factorization as if one of the factors is zero, then the whole polynomial is zero. So we can write the characteristic polynomial as where $c_n \neq 0$ is the leading coefficient:

```math
P(\lambda) = c_n (\lambda - \lambda_1)(\lambda - \lambda_2) \dots (\lambda - \lambda_k)
```

So for the input variable $\lambda$ we then have the eigenvalues, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_k$ as the roots of the polynomial. Some of the factors may be repeated, which means that the eigenvalue appears multiple times as a root of the polynomial. The number of distinct roots $k$ can be less than or equal to $n$, the degree of the polynomial. If we have repeated roots, we can factor them out as well:

```math
P(\lambda) = c_n (\lambda - \lambda_1)^{m_1} (\lambda - \lambda_2)^{m_2} \dots (\lambda - \lambda_k)^{m_k}
```

where now $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_k$ are the distinct eigenvalues and $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k$ is the **algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalues**, so the number of times the eigenvalue appears as a root of $P(\lambda)$, satisfying:

```math
m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_k = n
```

If we have factorized the polynomial and have found an eigenvalue $\lambda_1$, we can then recursively find the other eigenvalues by solving the polynomial:

```math
(\lambda - \lambda_1)^{m_1} P_2(\lambda) = c_n (\lambda - \lambda_2)^{m_2} \dots (\lambda - \lambda_k)^{m_k}
```

where $P_2(\lambda)$ is the polynomial obtained by dividing $P(\lambda)$ by $(\lambda - \lambda_1)^{m_1}$. This process can be repeated until we have found all the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and we only have constant term left in the polynomial.

<Callout type="example">
Suppose we have the matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
```

We can find the eigenvalues by calculating the characteristic polynomial:

```math
\begin{align*}
P(\lambda) &= \text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) \\
&= \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
0 - \lambda & -1 \\
1 & 0 - \lambda
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & -1 \\
1 & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - (-1)(1) \\
&= \lambda^2 + 1
\end{align*}
```

Solving the equation $P(\lambda) = 0$ gives us:

```math
\lambda^2 + 1 = 0 \implies \lambda^2 = -1 \implies \lambda = i, -i
```

We could also factorize the polynomial to get:

```math
P(\lambda) = (\lambda - i)(\lambda + i)
```

So we have the eigenvalues: $\lambda_1 = i$ and $\lambda_2 = -i$. The eigenvalues only appear once, so they are both distinct and therefore the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue is 1. 
</Callout>

To then find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues, forming a so-called **eigenvalue-eigenvector pair**, we can substitute the eigenvalue $\lambda$ back into the equation:

```math
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
```

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the eigenvector we are trying to find and is a complex vector so has the form:

```math
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
\vdots \\
v_n
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a + bi \\
c + di \\
\vdots \\
e + fi
\end{bmatrix}
```

Before calculating the eigenvector it is important to note that the eigenvector is not unique, as any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector. This means that if $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$, then $c\mathbf{v}$ for any non-zero scalar $c$ is also an eigenvector corresponding to the same eigenvalue $\lambda$. Therefore it is common to normalize the eigenvector, i.e., to choose a scalar $c$ such that the norm of the eigenvector is 1.

```math
\mathbf{A}(c\mathbf{v}) = \lambda (c\mathbf{v}) \implies \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
```

Because any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector, we can also say that the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair span a vector space, the **eigenspace** of the eigenvalue $\lambda$. The eigenspace is the set of all eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$ and is a subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$. The dimension of the eigenspace is called the **geometric multiplicity** of the eigenvalue $\lambda$ and is the number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$. We can also write the eigenspace as the nullspace of the matrix $\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$ as this is what we are solving for when we are looking for the eigenvectors:

```math
\it{E}_\lambda = \{\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n :\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\} = N(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \{\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n : (\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\}
```

<Callout type="example">
Let's continue with our previous example where we found the eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = i$ and $\lambda_2 = -i$ of the following matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
```

multiplying the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ gives us:

```math
\mathbf{Av} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-v_2 \\
v_1
\end{bmatrix} = i \begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix}
```

So we end up with the following systems of equations:

```math
\begin{vmatrix}
-v_2 &= i v_1 \\
v_1 &= i v_2
\end{vmatrix}
```

We can solve this system of equations by first solving for $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$:

```math
-v_2 = i v_1 \implies v_2 = -i v_1
```

Now substituting this into the second equation gives us:

```math
v_1 = i (-i v_1) \implies v_1 = v_1
```

So for the first component we can choose any value for $v_1$, and then we can find $v_2$ using the equation $v_2 = -i v_1$. For simplicity let's choose $v_1 = 1$, then we have:

```math
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-i
\end{bmatrix}
```

This is one possible eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = i$. We could have also chosen $v_1 = 2$, or any other non-zero value, and we would have obtained a different eigenvector, but it would still be a valid eigenvector corresponding to the same eigenvalue.

```math
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
-2i
\end{bmatrix}
```

For this reason we often normalize the eigenvector to have a norm of 1. The norm of the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ is given by:

```math
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + (-i)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}
```

So to normalize the eigenvector we divide it by its norm:

```math
\mathbf{v}_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-i
\end{bmatrix}
```

We can also check that this eigenvector satisfies the eigenvalue equation:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} &= \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-i
\end{bmatrix} &= i \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-i
\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
(0 \cdot 1 + -1 \cdot (-i)) \\
(1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot (-i))
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
(1 \cdot i) \\
(-i \cdot i)
\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
i \\
1
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
i \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
```

So we can see that the equality holds, and we have found a valid eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = i$. We can repeat this process for the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2 = -i$ to find the other eigenvector.

## Properties of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Now that we have seen how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors, let's explore some of the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let's start with the first property, **Every matrix has at least one eigenvalue**. This is a direct consequence of the the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, the characteristic polynomial $P(\lambda) = \text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I})$ has degree $n$ for an $n \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Therefore, it always has $n$ (not necessarily distinct) roots in $\mathbb{C}$, which are the eigenvalues. So there is at least one eigenvalue that has algebraic multiplicity greater or equal to 1. Even if $\mathbf{A}$ has no real eigenvalues, it will still have complex eigenvalues.

Even for the smallest matrix, the $1 \times 1$ matrix $\mathbf{A} = [a]$, the characteristic polynomial is $P(\lambda) = a - \lambda$, which has one root $\lambda = a$. So even a $1 \times 1$ matrix has an eigenvalue. 

The next property is that the **eigenvalues of a matrix and its transpose are the same**. We know that the determinant of a matrix and its transpose are equal, so the characteristic polynomial of $\mathbf{A}$ is the same as that of $\mathbf{A}^T$. This is because the characteristic polynomial only effects the diagonal elements of the matrix, and these diagonal elements stay the same when we take the transpose of the matrix. So we have:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}(\mathbf{A}^T - \lambda \mathbf{I})
```

This means that the the eigenvalues of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and its transpose $\mathbf{A}^T$ are identical. However, the eigenvectors are generally **not the same**. Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ and we take the transpose we then get:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A}^T = \lambda \mathbf{v}^T
\end{align*}
```

Thus, $\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}^T$, but the eigenvectors are different. With the same argument we can argue that the gaussian elimination can effect the eigenvalues as it changes the determinant of the matrix and therefore the characteristic polynomial. However, the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A}^T$ are the same.

<Callout type="example">
Consider $\mathbf{A}$:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are calculated by solving:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 0 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 0.
```

This gives eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = 3$.

Now for $\mathbf{A}^T$:

```math
\mathbf{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.
```

The characteristic polynomial is the same:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A}^T - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 0 \\ 1 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 0.
```

The eigenvalues are still $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = 3$. However, the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A}^T$ are not the same. For $\lambda = 2$, $\mathbf{v}\mathbf{A} \neq \mathbf{v}\mathbf{A}^T$. To show this we can first calculate the eigenvector for $\lambda = 2$ and $\mathbf{A}$:

```math
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{A} - 2 \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} &= 0 \\
\begin{bmatrix} 2-2 & 1 \\ 0 & 3-2 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
```

where $c$ is any non-zero scalar such as $c = 1$ to make the eigenvector a unit vector. If we now calculate the eigenvector for $\lambda = 2$ and $\mathbf{A}^T$ we get:

```math
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{A}^T - 2 \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} &= 0 \\
\begin{bmatrix} 2-2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3-2 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ c \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
```

where again $c$ is any non-zero scalar such as $c = 1$. So we can see that the eigenvectors are different for $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A}^T$ even though the eigenvalues are the same. The same would be for the case of $\lambda = 3$.
</Callout>

The next property is that **if $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the real matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, then their complex conjugates $\overline{\lambda}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{v}}$ are also an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of $\mathbf{A}$**. So real matrices with complex eigenvalues always have eigenvalues in **complex conjugate pairs**. So if we know one complex eigenvalue $\lambda$ and its corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ we automatically another pair of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, namely $\overline{\lambda}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{v}}$. It also follows that if $\mathbf{A}$ has a real eigenvalue, then it must have a real eigenvector. We can see this from the following equation:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\overline{\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}} = \overline{\lambda \mathbf{v}} \\
\mathbf{A} \overline{\mathbf{v}} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}}
\end{align*}
```

Since $\mathbf{A}$ has real entries, $\overline{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{A}$ so we get:

```math
\mathbf{A} \overline{\mathbf{v}} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{\mathbf{v}}.
```

<Callout type="todo">
symmetric matrices only have real eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so we can also say that if $\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric matrix, then all its eigenvalues are real and its eigenvectors are real.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
Suppose we again have the following matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
```

We then saw that we have the eigenvalue $\lambda = i$ with eigenvector $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix}$. The complex conjugate of the eigenvalue is $\overline{\lambda} = -i$ and the complex conjugate of the eigenvector is $\overline{\mathbf{v}} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix}$. Which matches our previous example where we found the eigenvalue $\lambda = -i$ with eigenvector $\overline{\mathbf{v}} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix}$.
</Callout>

The fourth property is that **if $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair for $\mathbf{A}$, then $\lambda^k$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair for $\mathbf{A}^k$**. To see this we simply use repeated application of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$. For the case of $k = 2$, we have:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^2 \mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}) \\
&= \mathbf{A}(\lambda \mathbf{v}) \\
&= \lambda (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}) \\
&= \lambda^2 \mathbf{v}.
\end{align*}
```

By induction, the result generalizes to $\mathbf{A}^k \mathbf{v} = \lambda^k \mathbf{v}$ as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^k \mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{A}^{k-1}(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}) \\
&= \mathbf{A}^{k-1}(\lambda \mathbf{v}) \\
&= \lambda \mathbf{A}^{k-1} \mathbf{v} \\
&= \lambda^k \mathbf{v}.
\end{align*}
```

From this it also follows that nilpotent matrices, which are matrices $\mathbf{A}$ such that $\mathbf{A}^k = \mathbf{0}$ for some positive integer $k$, have all eigenvalues equal to zero. This is because if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a nilpotent matrix $\mathbf{A}$, then $\lambda^k$ must also be an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}^k = \mathbf{0}$. However, the null matrix $\mathbf{0}$ has only one eigenvalue, which is zero. Therefore, all eigenvalues of a nilpotent matrix must be zero.

<Callout type="example">
To calculate the eigenvalues of the zero matrix $\mathbf{0}$:

```math
\mathbf{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
```

The characteristic polynomial is:

```math
P(\lambda) = \text{det}(\mathbf{0} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
- \lambda & 0 \\
0 & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix} = (-\lambda)(-\lambda) = \lambda^2
```

The roots of this polynomial are $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\lambda_2 = 0$, so the eigenvalues of the zero matrix are both zero. This is consistent with the property that nilpotent matrices have all eigenvalues equal to zero.
</Callout>

Next is the property that **if $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible with the eigenvalue-pair $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{v}$ then $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvalue-pair of $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$**.

```math
\mathbf{A} \text{ is invertible with eigenvalue-pair } \lambda \text{ and } \mathbf{v} \implies \mathbf{A}^{-1} \text{ has eigenvalue-pair } \frac{1}{\lambda} \text{ and } \mathbf{v}.
```

<Callout type="proof">
Because the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible the determinant is non-zero. Then recall that the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathbf{A}$ are roots of the characteristic equation: 

```math
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0 
``` 

Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvector $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$: 

```math
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} 
``` 

Now, since $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, **$\lambda$ cannot be zero**. If $\lambda = 0$, then we would have:

```math 
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}
``` 

which would mean that the non-zero vector $\mathbf{v}$ is in the nullspace of $\mathbf{A}$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, as an invertible matrix cannot have a non-trivial nullspace. Therefore, $\lambda \neq 0$. So we can then rewrite the eigenvalue equation as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}  
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} (\lambda \mathbf{v}) \\
\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \mathbf{v}
\end{align*}
```

Thus, $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$.
</Callout>

It is tempting to think that the eigenvalues of a sum of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ might correspond to the sum of the eigenvalues of the individual matrices, but this is not true in general. Eigenvalues depend on the structure of the matrix, which involves more than just summing matrix entries. 

Similarly, the eigenvalues of a product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ do not correspond to the product of their eigenvalues. This is because the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{AB}$ depend on whether $\mathbf{AB}$ and $\mathbf{BA}$ commute (i.e., if $\mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{BA}$). If they do not commute, the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{AB}$ are more complex to calculate.

<Callout type="example">
Here's an example to demonstrate this:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are $\lambda_1 = 1, \lambda_2 = 1$. The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{B}$ are $\mu_1 = 1, \mu_2 = -1$. If we add the matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, we get:

```math
\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
```

If we compute the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, we get $\lambda = 1 \pm \sqrt{3}$, which are not simply the sum of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ (i.e., $1 + 1$ or $1 + -1$). We can also show the same if we compute the eigenvalues of the product $\mathbf{AB}$:

```math
\mathbf{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{AB}$ are determined by solving:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{AB} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) =
\begin{vmatrix}
2 - \lambda & 1 \\
1 & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= (2 - \lambda)(-\lambda) - (1)(1) = 0.
```

Expanding:

```math
-\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 1 = 0.
```

This quadratic equation gives eigenvalues $\lambda = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}$, **which are not the product** of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ (i.e., $\lambda = 1 \cdot 1$ or $\lambda = 1 \cdot -1$).
</Callout>

Now we come to a key property. If all the eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_k$ of a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ are real and distinct so have algebraic multiplicity 1, then the real eigenvectors corresponding to those eigenvalues are **linearly independent**. This means that the $n$ eigenvectors form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, the so-called **eigenbasis** of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ if the eigenvalues are distinct. We say such a matrix has a **complete set of real eigenvectors**.

<Callout type="proof">
Suppose the eigenvectors are dependent. Then there exist scalars $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$, not all zero, such that:

```math
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0}
```

Let us choose such a relation with the smallest $k$ possible (i.e., with a minimal number of vectors). Applying $\mathbf{A}$ to both sides gives:

```math
\sum_{j=1}^k c_j \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_j = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{0}) = \mathbf{0} \implies
\sum_{j=1}^k c_j \lambda_j \mathbf{v}_j = \mathbf{0}
```

Now subtract $\lambda_1$ times the original equation:

```math
\sum_{j=1}^k c_j (\lambda_j - \lambda_1) \mathbf{v}_j = \mathbf{0}
```

But $(\lambda_1 - \lambda_1) = 0$, so the term for $j=1$ disappears:

```math
\sum_{j=2}^k c_j (\lambda_j - \lambda_1) \mathbf{v}_j = \mathbf{0}
```

All $(\lambda_j - \lambda_1) \neq 0$ (since eigenvalues are distinct), so this is a nontrivial dependence among $\mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k$, contradicting the minimality assumption. Therefore, all $c_j = 0$, and so the set ${\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k}$ is linearly independent.
</Callout>

We define the trace of the matrix as the sum of the diagonal elements:

```math
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^n A_{ii}.
```

The trace also has the following properties:
- **Addition**:$\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) + \text{Tr}(\mathbf{B})$
- **Scalar multiplication**: $\text{Tr}(c\mathbf{A}) = c \cdot \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A})$ for any scalar $c$.
- **Cyclic property**:$\text{Tr}(\mathbf{ABC}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{BCA}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{CAB})$ which means if $\mathbf{I}$ then the trace is also commutative so $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{AB}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{BA})$

<Callout type="proof">
The first two properties are obvious from the definition of the trace. The cyclic property can be shown by expanding the trace as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{ABC}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (ABC)_{ii} \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ij} B_{jk} C_{ki} \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n A_{ij} B_{jk} C_{ki} \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n C_{ki} B_{jk} A_{ij} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n C_{ki} B_{jk} A_{ij} \\
&= \text{Tr}(\mathbf{BCA}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{CAB}).
\end{align*}
```

The same can be done for the commutative property of the trace:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{AB}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (AB)_{ii} \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} B_{ji} \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n B_{ji} A_{ij} \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n (BA)_{ii} \\
&= \text{Tr}(\mathbf{BA}).
\end{align*}
```
</Callout>

However, with regards to eigenvalues and determinants, the trace has some more interesting properties. 
The trace of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues:

```math
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = \sum_{i=1}^k m_i \lambda_i
```

where $m_i$ is the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$. This means that if an eigenvalue appears multiple times, it is counted multiple times in the sum.

<Callout type="todo">
Better derivation of this or more explanation

From the definition of the characteristic polynomial:

```math
P(\lambda) = \text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}),
```

the coefficient of $\lambda^{n-1}$ (from expanding the determinant) is $(-1)^{n-1} \cdot \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A})$, which equals the sum of the eigenvalues.
</Callout>

So from this it follows that if we add two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, then the sum of the resulting matrices eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues of the individual matrices:

```math
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) = \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) + \text{Tr}(\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n+m} \nu_i
```

where $\nu_i$ are the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, and $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ respectively.

<Callout type="example">
Let:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are $\lambda_1 = -0.372$, $\lambda_2 = 5.372$.

```math
\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) = 1 + 4 = 5 = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2.
```
</Callout>

We can also show that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
```

<Callout type="todo">
Better derivation of this or more explanation
From the characteristic polynomial:

```math
P(\lambda) = (-1)^n \Big( \prod_{i=1}^n (\lambda - \lambda_i) \Big),
```

evaluating $P(0)$ gives $\text{det}(\mathbf{A}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i$.
</Callout>

This also then has the direct consequence that if the determinant of a matrix is zero, then at least one of the eigenvalues is zero. So all  matrices that are not invertible have at least one eigenvalue of zero. This also means tht if a matrix has an eigenvalue of zero, then it is not invertible.

This is also another way of explaining why if $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, then $\lambda \neq 0$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathbf{A}$ because if $\lambda = 0$, then the determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ would be zero, which contradicts the assumption that $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible.

<Callout type="example">
Suppose we have the following matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 4 \\
2 & 3
\end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are calculated by solving:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) &= \text{det}\begin{bmatrix} 5 - \lambda & 4 \\ 2 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \\
&= (5 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) - (4)(2) \\
&= \lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 7 = 0.
\end{align*}
```

Solving this with the quadratic formula gives us:

```math
\lambda = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 7}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2} = \frac{8 \pm 6}{2}.
```

This gives us the eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 7$ and $\lambda_2 = 1$. The determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ is:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A}) = (5)(3) - (4)(2) = 15 - 8 = 7.
```

This matches with the product of the eigenvalues.
</Callout>

## Eigenvalues of Orthogonal Matrices

Interestingly, because orthogonal matrices preserve lengths and angles, the eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix are all either 1 or -1. This can be shown by considering the following equation:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\| \mathbf{Av} \| = \| \lambda \mathbf{v} \| \\
\| \mathbf{v} \| = | \lambda | \| \mathbf{v} |
\end{align*}
```

Another way to see this is that the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is either 1 or -1 and we said that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. So if we have an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{A}$, then we can write:

```math
\text{det}(\mathbf{A}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = \pm 1.
```

## Eigenvalues of Diagonal Matrices

Interestingly the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are simply the diagonal elements and the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. We can see this when we set the eigenvector to be the standard basis vector $\mathbf{e}_i$. All it does is select the $i$-th diagonal element of the matrix.

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Dv} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
d_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & d_2 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & d_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
1 \\
\vdots \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
= d_i \mathbf{e}_i = \lambda \mathbf{e}_i
\end{align*}
```

This also matches with the idea that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, as the trace of a diagonal matrix is simply the sum of its diagonal elements. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is also the product of its diagonal elements, which again matches with the idea that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. 

Because the eigenvectors of a diagonal matrix are the standard basis vectors, they are also linearly independent and span $\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that a diagonal matrix always has a complete set of eigenvectors.

## Eigenvalues of Triangular Matrices

The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix (upper or lower triangular) are also simply the diagonal elements. This is because the characteristic polynomial of a triangular matrix is given by the product of the diagonal elements minus $\lambda$. This can easily be seen in the 2d case:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{det}(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) &= \text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} - \lambda & a_{12} \\
0 & a_{22} - \lambda
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= (a_{11} - \lambda)(a_{22} - \lambda) - 0 \\
&= (a_{11} - \lambda)(a_{22} - \lambda).
\end{align*}
```

This means that the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are simply the diagonal elements. However unlike diagonal matrices, the eigenvectors of triangular matrices are not necessarily the standard basis vectors. 

<Callout type="example">
Suppose we have the following upper triangular matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.
```

Then we have the eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 1$, $\lambda_2 = 4$, and $\lambda_3 = 6$. Now let's find the eigenvectors. For $\lambda_1 = 1$, we have:

```math
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{A} - 1 \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{0} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
1 - 1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 - 1 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 6 - 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
v_3
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 3 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
v_3
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align*}

this results in the following equations:

```math
2v_2 + 3v_3 = 0 \text{ and } 3v_2 + 5v_3 = 0 \text{ and } 5v_3 = 0.
```

This means that $v_3 = 0$, and substituting this into the first equation gives $2v_2 = 0$, so $v_2 = 0$. The first equation then gives us $v_1$ can be any value. So we have the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.
</Callout>

## Diagonalization

Once we have calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, we can write them as a set of equations so:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_1 &= \lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1, \\
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_2 &= \lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2, \\
&\vdots \\
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_n &= \lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n.
\end{align*}
```

We can also express this in matrix form as:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \dots & \mathbf{v}_n
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1 & \lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2 & \dots & \lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n
\end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{V} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v_1} & \mathbf{v_2} & \dots & \mathbf{v_n}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{V} &= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D},
\end{align*}
```

where $\mathbf{V}$ is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$. Now remember that some matrices have a complete set of eigenvectors, meaning that the eigenvectors span the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and that the eigenvectors are linearly independent. If this is the case, then we say that the matrix is **diagonalizable**. This means that the matrix $\mathbf{V}$ is invertible, and we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ to get:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{V}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{V} &= \mathbf{D} \\
\mathbf{A} &= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{-1}.
\end{align*}
```

Diagonalization is a powerful concept in linear algebra, as it allows us to simplify the representation of a matrix and understand its properties more easily. This factorization of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is called the **eigendecomposition**.
 
For $\mathbf{A}$ to be diagonalizable, it must have a **complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors**, meaning the eigenvectors must form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is the case when the eigenvalues are distinct. But there are other cases where $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable such as if the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue equals its geometric multiplicity. Where the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\lambda$ is the number of times $\lambda$ appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial, and the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda$, which is the null space of $\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$.

The geometric multiplicity of $\lambda$ is always less than or equal to its algebraic multiplicity. If the geometric multiplicity equals the algebraic multiplicity for all eigenvalues, then $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable and there are enough eigenvectors to form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. The Intuition behind this is that each eigenvalue then picks an eigenvector that is linearly independent from the others so one of each direction spanning the eigenspace. 

On the other hand, if $\mathbf{A}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue is 1, and the geometric multiplicity is also 1. This means that the eigenvectors are linearly independent and span $\mathbb{R}^n$, so $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable. 

A matrix that is not diagonalizable is called **defective**. Common examples of defective matrices are the nilpotent matrices, which have all eigenvalues equal to zero but do not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis.

<Callout type="example">
For example, consider the matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$ has algebraic multiplicity 2. However, the null space of $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is spanned by $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, so the geometric multiplicity is 1. Since these multiplicities differ, $\mathbf{A}$ is not diagonalizable, as it lacks a complete set of eigenvectors.
</Callout>

The name **diagonalization** comes from the fact that we are looking for some sort of basis in which the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be represented as a diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$. This is because in this basis, the action of the matrix becomes very simple: it just makes a vector stretch or compress along the directions of the new basis vectors (the eigenvectors). Geometrically this can be though of as transforming the space so that the eigenvectors align with the axes, and the eigenvalues represent how much the matrix stretches or compresses along those axes and then we finally transform back to the original space using the inverse of the transformation matrix $\mathbf{V}$. Remember that the eigenvectors are the vectors that when multiplied by the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, result in a vector that is a scalar multiple of the original vector. So if we represent a vector $\mathbf{x}$ in the eigenvector basis, then applying the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{x}$ results in a vector that is simply scaled by the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors in that basis. To then transform back to the original space, we use the inverse of the matrix $\mathbf{V}$.

<Image

Suppose the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$ are $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n$, and they form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Any vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:

```math
\mathbf{x} = a_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + a_n \mathbf{v}_n.
```

Now, consider applying the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{x}$. Because eigenvectors satisfy $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i$, the result simplifies to:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{A}(a_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + a_n \mathbf{v}_n) \\
&= \lambda_1 a_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + \lambda_2 a_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + \lambda_n a_n \mathbf{v}_n.
\end{align*}
```

So we can see that in this eigenvector basis, $\mathbf{A}$ acts as a stretching transformation, scaling each eigenvector by its eigenvalue. 

<Callout type="todo">
What is this supposed to mean?

The general idea of changing the basis where we have the basis U and V and transformation that maps X to L(x) = Ax?

B=V^{-1}AU, 
where $B$ is the matrix representation of the linear transformation in the new basis. For diagonalizable matrice we can choose U=V.

To better understand diagonalization, consider a **projection matrix** $\mathbf{P}$ that projects vectors onto a subspace $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a matrix satisfies $\mathbf{P}^2 = \mathbf{P}$. The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{P}$ are $\lambda = 1$ for vectors in $S$ and $\lambda = 0$ for vectors in the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$. The eigenvectors of $\mathbf{P}$ form a complete basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, consisting of basis vectors for $S$ and $S^\perp$. Since $\mathbf{P}$ has a complete set of eigenvectors, it is diagonalizable.
</Callout>

## Inverse via Eigendecomposition

If a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable and invertible, we can express its inverse using the eigendecomposition. The inverse of $\mathbf{A}$ can be computed as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} &= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{-1} \\
\mathbf{A}^{-1} &= (\mathbf{V} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{-1})^{-1} \\
\mathbf{A}^{-1} &= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{D}^{-1} \mathbf{V}^{-1},
\end{align*}
```

where $\mathbf{D}^{-1}$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $\frac{1}{\lambda_i}$, provided that all eigenvalues $\lambda_i \neq 0$. This shows that if $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, then its eigendecomposition can be used to compute the inverse.

## Eigenvalues of Similar Matrices

We say that two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are **similar** if there exists an invertible matrix $\mathbf{S}$ such that:

```math
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{S}.
```

We can also rewrite this in terms of $\mathbf{A}$:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{S} \\
\mathbf{S} \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{S} \\
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{S}^{-1}.
\end{align*}
```

If $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are similar, they share the same eigenvalues.

<Callout type="proof">
To show this, consider we have an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $\mathbf{A}$ with corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$. We then want to show that $\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{B}$ with corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{w}$. Remember we only said that the eigenvalues are the same, not the eigenvectors. This results in the following:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} &= \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{S}\mathbf{B} \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{v} &= \lambda \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{B} \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{v} &= \lambda \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{v} \\
\mathbf{B} \mathbf{w} &= \lambda \mathbf{w},
\end{align*}
```

where we set $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mathbf{v}$. This shows that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{B}$ with eigenvector $\mathbf{w}$. We can also show the reverse direction, that if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{B}$, then it is also an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$ in a similar manner. Thus, the eigenvalues of similar matrices are the same.
</Callout>

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Symmetric Matrices

Symmetric matrices possess special properties that make them fundamentally important in linear algebra. If $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is symmetric then we have:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^T.
```

Then another property is that the **eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are always real**. 

<Callout type="proof">
We can show this as follows. First we assume by contradication that $\lambda$ is a complex eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$ with corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$. Then we have also have its complex conjugate $\bar{\lambda}$ with corresponding eigenvector $\bar{\mathbf{v}}$:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} &= \lambda \mathbf{v}, \\
\mathbf{A} \bar{\mathbf{v}} &= \bar{\lambda} \bar{\mathbf{v}}.
\end{align*}
```

We can then use the complex conjugate to calculate the norm of the eigenvector:

```math
\begin{align*}
\lambda\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 &= \bar{\mathbf{v}}^T \lambda \mathbf{v} = \bar{\mathbf{v}}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} \\
\bar{\lambda}\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 &= \mathbf{v}^T \bar{\lambda} \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A}^T \bar{\mathbf{v}} 
\end{align*}
```

Now, since $\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric, we have:

```math
\begin{align*}
\hat{\mathbf{v}}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} &= (\hat{\mathbf{v}}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v})^T \\
&= \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A}^T \hat{\mathbf{v}} \\
&= \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A} \hat{\mathbf{v}} 
\end{align*}
```

This means that the left-hand side of the first equation is equal to the left-hand side of the second equation, so if we subtract the two equations we get:

```math
\begin{align*}
\hat{\lambda} \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 - \lambda \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 &= \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A} \hat{\mathbf{v}} - \hat{\mathbf{v}}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} \\
(\hat{\lambda} - \lambda) \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 &= \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A} \hat{\mathbf{v}} - \mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{A} \hat{\mathbf{v}} \\
(\hat{\lambda} - \lambda) \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
```

For this to hold, either $\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 0$ (which means $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$, contradicting the definition of an eigenvector) or $\hat{\lambda} = \lambda$. Thus, all eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real.
</Callout>

Another nice property of symmetric matrices is that their eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. This property follows directly from the symmetry of $\mathbf{A}$. Let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be symmetric, and let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$ corresponding to the eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, respectively, with $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$. Then, from the definition of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we have:

```math
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u} = \lambda_1 \mathbf{u}, \quad \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda_2 \mathbf{v}.
```

If we take the dot product of the first equation with $\mathbf{v}$ we get:

```math
\mathbf{v}^T (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u}) = \lambda_1 (\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{u}).
```

Now take the dot product of the second equation with $\mathbf{u}$:

```math
\mathbf{u}^T (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}) = \lambda_2 (\mathbf{u}^T \mathbf{v}).
```

Since $\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric, $\mathbf{u}^T (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}) = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u})^T \mathbf{v}$. Therefore, the left-hand sides of the two equations are the same:

```math
\lambda_1 (\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{u}) = \lambda_2 (\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{u}).
```

Because $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$, the only way this equation can hold is if $\mathbf{v}^T \mathbf{u} = 0$, which means $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal. Thus, eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. And because the length of the eigenvectors can be normalized, we can also say that the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix can be chosen to be orthonormal.

So if the symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, we can find $n$ orthonormal eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$ such that:

```math
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i, \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n,
```

where $\lambda_i$ are the distinct eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ are the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. This means that we can construct an orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{Q}$ whose columns are these eigenvectors:

```math
\mathbf{Q} = [\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n].
```

This orthogonal matrix $\mathbf{Q}$ has the property that $\mathbf{Q}^T = \mathbf{Q}^{-1}$, meaning that it preserves lengths and angles when transforming vectors. Because the eigenvectors are orthonormal, we can also use this matrix to diagonalize the symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using the eigendecomposition:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{Q}^T,
```

where $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$ on its diagonal. This shows that symmetric matrices can be expressed in terms of their eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors, which is a powerful result in linear algebra.

However, we still have the issue that we need distinct eigenvalues to guarantee that the eigenvectors are orthogonal. But we can also show that if a symmetric matrix has repeated eigenvalues, we can still find an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. This is because the eigenspace corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue can be spanned by orthonormal vectors using the Gram-Schmidt process or other orthogonalization methods.

<Callout type="todo">
It remains to be proven that for symmetric matrices, the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue equals its geometric multiplicity, ensuring that we can always find enough orthonormal eigenvectors to form a complete basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
</Callout>

This results in the **spectral theorem** which states that if $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a symmetric matrix, then it satisfies the following:
1. Every symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has real $n$ eigenvalues.
2. Its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Which means that we can **always diagonalize a symmetric matrix** using its eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. 

If we write out the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$, we have:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{Q}^T \\
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \dots & \mathbf{v}_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1^T \\
\mathbf{v}_2^T \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{v}_n^T
\end{bmatrix}
```

If first multiply $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{Q}^T$ we get a matrix where each row is scaled by the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_i$:

```math
\mathbf{D} \mathbf{Q}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1^T \\
\mathbf{v}_2^T \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{v}_n^T
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1^T \\
\lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2^T \\
\vdots \\
\lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n^T
\end{bmatrix}.
```

Then multiplying this by $\mathbf{Q}$ gives us:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{v}_1 & \mathbf{v}_2 & \dots & \mathbf{v}_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1^T \\
\lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2^T \\
\vdots \\
\lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n^T
\end{bmatrix}
```

So we can rewrite the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix as:

```math
\matbhf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathf{v}_i (\lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i^T) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T.
```

where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues and $\mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T$ is the projection matrix onto the direction of $\mathbf{v}_i$. This decomposition reveals how $\mathbf{A}$ stretches or compresses space along its eigenvector directions. Symmetric matrices possess these convenient properties, making them particularly important in many applications. 

Notice that we actually have a sum of scaled outer products of the eigenvectors and we remember that the outer product $\mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T$ is a rank-1 matrix. This means that the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix can be viewed as a sum of rank-1 matrices, each scaled by its corresponding eigenvalue.

Because the rank of the decomposition can not exceed the number of these rank-1 matrices, we can also conclude that the **rank of a symmetric matrix** is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues as each non-zero eigenvalue contributes a rank-1 component to the decomposition. If the eigenvalue is zero, the corresponding outer product $\mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T$ does not contribute to the rank of the matrix as it results in a zero matrix.

## The Rayleigh Quotient

For any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, the Rayleigh Quotient is defined as:

```math
R(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}}{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x}}.
```

The Rayleigh Quotient provides a way of measuring how the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ “acts” on the direction of $\mathbf{x}$, normalized by the squared length of $\mathbf{x}$. Geometrically, $R(\mathbf{x})$ tells us how much $\mathbf{A}$ stretches or compresses the vector $\mathbf{x}$, relative to its own length.

Recall that any symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be diagonalized as $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{Q}^T$, where $\mathbf{Q}$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix with the corresponding real eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ on the diagonal.

We can always express any $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$:

```math
\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \mathbf{v}_i,
```

if we left multiply this by $\mathbf{v}_i^T$ we get the following because the eigenvectors are orthonormal so their dot product is 1 if they are the same vector and 0 otherwise:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \mathbf{v}_i, \\
\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_i^T \left( \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \mathbf{v}_j \right) \\
\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{x} = \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_j = c_i,
\end{align*}
```

where $c_i = \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{x}$ is the coefficient of the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$ in the linear combination. We also remember that we can write the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the spectral decomposition:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T.
```

Now using this, we can calcualte the denominator of the Rayleigh Quotient:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x} &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \mathbf{v}_i \right)^T \left( \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \mathbf{v}_j \right) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_i \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2,
\end{align*}
```

where we used the fact that the eigenvectors are orthonormal, so $\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_j = 0$ for $i \ne j$ and $\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_i = 1$. We can do the same for the numerator of the Rayleigh Quotient:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \mathbf{v}_i \right)^T \left( \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \mathbf{v}_j \right) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \lambda_i.
\end{align*}
```

Putting these together, we can express the Rayleigh Quotient as:

```math
R(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2}.
```

So the Rayleigh Quotient is a weighted average of the eigenvalues, where the weights $w_i = \frac{c_i^2}{\sum_j c_j^2}$ are non-negative and sum to 1. Because of this, the Rayleigh Quotient $R(\mathbf{x})$ is bounded by the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$. Specifically, we have:

```math
\lambda_{\text{min}} \leq R(\mathbf{x}) \leq \lambda_{\text{max}},
```

where $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, respectively. We can also see that the Rayleigh Quotient achieves its minimum value $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ when $\mathbf{x}$ is aligned with the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue, and its maximum value $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ when $\mathbf{x}$ is aligned with the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. This is because if we set $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v}_i$ for some eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$, then the Rayleigh Quotient simplifies to:

```math
\begin{align*}
R(\mathbf{v}_i) &= \frac{\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i}{\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_i} \\
&= \frac{\lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_i}{\mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_i} \\
&= \lambda_i.
\end{align*}
```

We could also have seen that then the coefficients $c_i$ are such that $c_i = 1$ for the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $c_j = 0$ for all other eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_j$ with $j \ne i$. This means that the Rayleigh Quotient is equal to the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ corresponding to the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$.

## Positive Definite and Positive Semi-Definite Matrices

We can now use the Rayleigh Quotient to show that symmetric matrices can be classified as **positive definite** or **positive semi-definite**. 

We call a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ **positive definite (PD)** if all its eigenvalues are positive:

```math
\text{PD: } \mathbf{A} \text{ is positive definite} \quad \iff \quad
\lambda_i > 0 \quad \text{for all } i.
```

We call a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ **positive semi-definite (PSD)** if all its eigenvalues are non-negative:

```math
\text{PSD: } \mathbf{A} \text{ is positive semi-definite} \quad \iff \quad
\lambda_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i.
```

By using the Rayleigh Quotient, we can show that these properties are equivalent to the following conditions:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{PD: } & \mathbf{A} \text{ is positive definite} \quad \iff \quad R(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x} \ne \mathbf{0} \iff \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} > 0 \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x} \ne \mathbf{0}, \\
\text{PSD: } & \mathbf{A} \text{ is positive semi-definite} \quad \iff \quad R(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \iff \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n.
\end{align*}
```

<Callout type="proof">
This is derived from the following. If we are given a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with spectral decomposition:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T,
```

we can say for any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x}$:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \lambda_i,
```

where $c_i = \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{x}$ as before. Then if $\mathbf{A}$ is positive definite, then all eigenvalues $\lambda_i > 0$, which means that for any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x}$, we have:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \lambda_i > 0.
```

If $\mathbf{A}$ is positive semi-definite, then all eigenvalues $\lambda_i \geq 0$, which means that for any vector $\mathbf{x}$, we have:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2 \lambda_i \geq 0.
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
We want to check if the following matrix is positive definite:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.
```

First we find the eigenvalues by solving $\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0$.

```math
\begin{align*}
\det\left( \begin{bmatrix} 2 - \lambda & -1 \\ -1 & 2 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) &= (2 - \lambda)^2 - (-1)(-1) \\
&= (2 - \lambda)^2 - 1 \\
&= \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 3 = 0.
\end{align*}
```

```math
\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 3 = 0 \implies \lambda = 1,\, 3.
```

Solving for the eigenvalues we then get the values $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = 3$. Since both are positive, $\mathbf{A}$ is positive definite.
</Callout>

A property of positive definite (or positive semi-definite) matrices is that summing two positive definite matrices results in another positive definite (or positive semi-definite) matrix. This can be shown using the Rayleigh Quotient:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T (\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x} > 0 \text{ for all } \mathbf{x} \ne \mathbf{0},
```

This is a similar property as for the sum of symmetric matrices, where the sum of two symmetric matrices is also symmetric. Meaning we can combine these two properties to show that the sum of two symmetric positive definite (or positive semi-definite) matrices is also symmetric positive definite (or positive semi-definite).

## Gram Matrix

A **Gram matrix** is a weird but useful matrix. If we are given a set of vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$, the Gram matrix $\mathbf{G}$ is an $n \times n$ matrix where each entry is the dot product of the vectors:

```math
(\mathbf{G})_{ij} = \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{v}_j.
```

The Gram matrix can be expressed as:

```math
\mathbf{G} = \begin{bmatrix}
(\mathbf{v}_1^T \mathbf{v}_1) & (\mathbf{v}_1^T \mathbf{v}_2) & \dots & (\mathbf{v}_1^T \mathbf{v}_n) \\
(\mathbf{v}_2^T \mathbf{v}_1) & (\mathbf{v}_2^T \mathbf{v}_2) & \dots & (\mathbf{v}_2^T \mathbf{v}_n) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
(\mathbf{v}_n^T \mathbf{v}_1) & (\mathbf{v}_n^T \mathbf{v}_2) & \dots & (\mathbf{v}_n^T \mathbf{v}_n)
\end{bmatrix}.
```

We can quickly see that the Gram matrix is symmetric, as $(\mathbf{G})_{ij} = (\mathbf{G})_{ji}$ and that on the diagonal we have the squared norms of the vectors: $(\mathbf{G})_{ii} = \|\mathbf{v}_i\|^2$. Because the dot product is always non-negative, all entries of the Gram matrix are non-negative.

If we summarize the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$ into a matrix $\mathbf{V}$ we can also express the Gram matrix as: 

```math
\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{V}^T \mathbf{V}
```

where $\mathbf{V}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix whose columns are the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$. So in other words the useful matrix $\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}$ is a Gram matrix. Because this matrix and its counterpart $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^T$ often come together we also sometimes to $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^T$ as a Gram matrix allthough it is a bit of an abuse of notation.

Apart from being symmetric, the Gram matrices also have the nice property of being positive semi-definite, so all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. This can be shown using the Rayleigh Quotient. For any vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{G} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T (\mathbf{V}^T \mathbf{V}) \mathbf{x} = (\mathbf{V} \mathbf{x})^T (\mathbf{V} \mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{V} \mathbf{x}\|^2 > 0.
```

the same can be shown for the matrix $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$:

```math
\mathbf{x}^T (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T) \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{x})^T (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{x}\|^2 \geq 0.
```

## Cholesky Decomposition

The **Cholesky decomposition** is a special case of the eigendecomposition that applies to symmetric positive definite matrices. It provides a way to factor such matrices into a product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose. More specifically if we have a gram matrix $\mathbf{G}$, so a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, then we can decomposed it as:

```math
\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{C}^T \mathbf{C},
```

where $\mathbf{C}$ is a lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries. The idea is we define the "square root" of a diagonal matrix by taking the square root of its diagonal entries. We can see that this is does not change the matrix as long as the square root is well defined, i.e the elements on the diagonal are non-negative:

```math
\mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix}
d_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & d_2 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & d_n
\end{bmatrix} \implies \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{d_1} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \sqrt{d_2} & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \sqrt{d_n}
\end{bmatrix}
```

Multiply this matrix by itself gives us back the original diagonal matrix:

```math
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{d_1} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \sqrt{d_2} & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \sqrt{d_n}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{d_1} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \sqrt{d_2} & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & \sqrt{d_n}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
(\sqrt{d_1})^2 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & (\sqrt{d_2})^2 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & (\sqrt{d_n})^2
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
d_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & d_2 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & d_n
\end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{D}.
\end{align*}
```

We can then use this to define the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathbf{A}$ using the eigendecomposition because the gram matrix is symmetric and we have no issue taking the square root of the diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ as the eigenvalues are non-negative due to the gram matrix being positive semi-definite.

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} &= \mathbf{B} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{B}^T \\
&= \mathbf{B} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \mathbf{B}^T \\
&= \left( \mathbf{B} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \right) \left( \mathbf{B} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \right)^T.
\end{align*}
```

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. We can take the transpose of the matrix $\sqrt{\mathbf{D}}$ without any issues because it is a diagonal matrix, so the transpose is just the same matrix. To then make the matrices lower triangular we use the QR decomposition where $\mathbf{Q}$ is an orthogonal matrix and $\mathbf{R}$ is an upper triangular matrix. We can then write the Cholesky decomposition with $(\mathbf{B}\sqrt{\mathbf{D}})^T = \mathbf{QR}$ as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A} &= \left( \mathbf{B} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \right) \left( \mathbf{B} \sqrt{\mathbf{D}} \right)^T \\
&= \left( \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}\right)^T \left( \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}\right) \\
&= \mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{Q}^T \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R} \\
&= \mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{R} \\
&= \mathbf{C}^T \mathbf{C},
\end{align*}
```

where $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{R}$ is a lower triangular matrix. This shows that we can decompose a symmetric positive definite matrix into a product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose, which is the Cholesky decomposition.

## Singular Value Decomposition

We have seen that the eigendecomposition of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ provides a useful way to understand its action on vectors. However, only square matrices have eigendecompositions, and not all square matrices are diagonalizable.

With the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, we can generalize the eigendecomposition to all matrices, providing deep insights into their structure. The SVD is an essential tool in numerical analysis, statistics, and many engineering fields.

Before we delve into the SVD, let's first understand the relationship between the matrices $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$. So for any matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, we will consider the matrices:
- $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.
- $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$.

We already know a few things about these matrices:
- Both $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$ are symmetric.
- Both $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$ have the same rank as $\mathbf{A}$. 
This is because all we are doing is taking linear combinations of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$.

They also have the property of having the same non-zero eigenvalues. So the non-zero eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ are the same as those of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$.

This needs to be shown but for now we will just take it as a fact.

We are now ready to define the Singular Value Decomposition. The **Singular Value Decomposition** of $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a factorization of the form:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^T,
```

where:
- $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is an orthogonal matrix ($\mathbf{U}^T \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}$).
- $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an orthogonal matrix ($\mathbf{V}^T \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}$).
- $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. 
where $r = \text{rank}(\mathbf{A})$, and $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \dots \geq \sigma_r > 0$ are the **singular values** of $\mathbf{A}$.

So if we visualize the matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, it will look like this:

  ```math
  \mathbf{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
  0 & \sigma_2 & \dots & 0 \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \dots & \sigma_r \\
  & & & \\
  & & \mathbf{0}_{(m - r) \times (n - r)} &
  \end{bmatrix},
  ```

We can actually be more specific about the contents of the matrices:
- **Left Singular Vectors:** The columns of $\mathbf{U}$ are the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$.
- **Right Singular Vectors:** The columns of $\mathbf{V}$ are the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$.
- **Singular Values:** The square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of both $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$.

So we get the right Singular Vectors $\mathbf{V}$ from the eigenvalue decomposition of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$:

```math
\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i,
```

where $\lambda_i = \sigma_i^2$ and the left Singular Vectors $\mathbf{U}$ from the eigenvalue decomposition of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$:


```math
\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i) = \mathbf{A} (\lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i) \implies (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T) (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i) = \lambda_i (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i).
```

Thus, $\mathbf{u}_i = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i / \sigma_i$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$ corresponding to $\lambda_i$. The singular values $\sigma_i$ are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$. And because of our earlier statement, we know that the non-zero eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ are the same as those of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$. 

For practical computations, especially when $\mathbf{A}$ has rank $r < \min(m, n)$, we can express the SVD using only the non-zero singular values and their corresponding singular vectors:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \sigma_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T.
```

This representation highlights how $\mathbf{A}$ can be decomposed into a sum of rank-1 matrices. Which is then also the so called singular value theorem that every real matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ can be decomposed as:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^T.
```

This implies that any linear transformation represented by $\mathbf{A}$ can be viewed as:
1. Rotating or reflecting vectors using $\mathbf{V}^T$.
2. Scaling along principal axes using $\mathbf{\Sigma}$.
3. Rotating or reflecting the result using $\mathbf{U}$.

Let's look at an example of computing the SVD of a matrix. We are given the matrix:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
```

**Step 1:** Compute $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$:

```math
\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}.
```

**Step 2:** Find the eigenvalues ($\sigma_i^2$) and eigenvectors ($\mathbf{v}_i$) of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$.

- Eigenvalues: $\lambda_1 = 1$, $\lambda_2 = 4$
- Singular values: $\sigma_1 = 1$, $\sigma_2 = 2$
- Eigenvectors:
    - For $\lambda_1 = 1$: $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
    - For $\lambda_2 = 4$: $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

**Step 3:** Compute $\mathbf{u}_i = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i / \sigma_i$.

- $\mathbf{u}_1 = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_1 / 1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $\mathbf{u}_2 = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_2 / 2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$

**Step 4:** Form $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and $\mathbf{V}$.

- $\mathbf{U} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $\mathbf{V}^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

**Conclusion:** The SVD of $\mathbf{A}$ is:

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
```

### Application of SVD

SVD has numerous applications in data analysis, machine learning, and signal processing. 

**Low-Rank Approximation:** By keeping the largest $k$ singular values and setting the rest to zero, we obtain the best rank-$k$ approximation of $\mathbf{A}$ in terms of the Frobenius norm.

```math
\mathbf{A} \approx \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T.
```

**Calculating the Inverse (When $\mathbf{A}$ is Invertible):**

```math
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{U}^T.
```

**Calculating the Pseudo-Inverse (When $\mathbf{A}$ is Not Invertible):**

```math
\mathbf{A}^\dagger = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Sigma}^\dagger \mathbf{U}^T,
```

where $\mathbf{\Sigma}^\dagger$ is formed by taking reciprocals of the non-zero singular values because $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is diagonal.
