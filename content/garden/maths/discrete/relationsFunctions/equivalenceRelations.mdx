# Equivalence Relations

A relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if it is reflex, symmetric and transitive. To show that the relation 
$R$ is an equivalence relation, we can write instead of $aRb$, $a \equiv b$ or $a \sim b$ if the relation is clear and 
$a$ is related to $b$. If the relation is not clear, we can write $a \equiv_R b$ or $a \sim_R b$.

Therefore we know that a relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if it satisfies the following properties:

- $\forall a \in A, a \equiv_R a$ (reflexive)
- $\forall a, b \in A, a \equiv_R b \implies b \equiv_R a$ (symmetric)
- $\forall a, b, c \in A, a \equiv_R b \land b \equiv_R c \implies a \equiv_R c$ (transitive)

This makes sense if we compare it to our normal understanding of "equivalence":
- We say that two things that are the same are equivalent to each other (reflexive).
- If something is equivalent to something else, then that something else is equivalent to the first thing (symmetric).
- If something is equivalent to something else, and that something else is equivalent to another thing, then the first thing is equivalent to the other thing (transitive).

<Callout type="example">
For the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, the relation $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2,3), (3, 2)\}$ is an equivalence relation.

- The relation $R$ is reflexive because $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) \in R$.
- The relation $R$ is symmetric because $(2, 3), (3, 2) \in R$. $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ do not have to be in $R$.
- The relation $R$ is transitive because $(2, 3), (3, 2) \in R$ and $(2, 2), (3, 3) \in R$.

## Equivalence Classes

Given an equivalence relation $R$ on a set $A$, the equivalence class is a subset of $A$ that contains all the elements that are equivalent to a given element $a \in A$. 
The equivalence class of $a$ is denoted by $[a]$ if the relation is clear, or $[a]_R$ if the relation is not clear. 
More formally, the equivalence class of $a$ is defined as:

```math
[a]_R = \{b \in A | a \equiv_R b\}
```

Because of the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties of the equivalence relation, the equivalence classes partition the set $A$ into subsets 
that must either be equal or disjoint. So for any elements $a, b \in A$:

- If $a \equiv_R b$, then $[a]_R = [b]_R$ 
- Or if $a \not\equiv_R b$, then $[a]_R \cap [b]_R = \emptyset$.

<Callout type="example">
For the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the equivalence relation $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2,3), (3, 2)\}$, the equivalence classes are:

- $[1]_R = \{1\}$
- $[2]_R = \{2, 3\}$
- $[3]_R = \{2, 3\}$

As we can see, $[2]_R = [3]_R$ and $[1]_R \cap [2]_R = \emptyset$ and therefore the equivalence classes partition the set $A$.

### Equivalence Classes as Modulo
