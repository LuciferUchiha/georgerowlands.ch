# Intervals and Bounds

If we have a [set of real numbers](/garden/maths/discrete/setTheory#real-numbers), we can define a [subset](/garden/maths/discrete/setTheory#sub-and-superset) of this set by specifying a range of values. This subset is called an interval. To define an interval, we need two real numbers, $a$ and $b$, with $a \leq b$. We can then define the following types of intervals:

- **Open interval**: We include all the numbers between $a$ and $b$, but not $a$ and $b$ themselves. This is denoted as $(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x < b\}$. More precisely, an open interval does not include it's two endpoints.
- **Closed interval**: We include all the numbers between $a$ and $b$, as well as $a$ and $b$ themselves. This is denoted as $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b\}$. A closed interval includes both endpoints and all the numbers in between.
- **Half-open interval**: We include one of the endpoints but not the other. This is denoted as $[a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x < b\}$ or $(a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x \leq b\}$. As you might have guessed, a half-open interval only includes one of the two endpoints.
- **Unbounded/Infinite interval**: On one or both sides, the interval extends indefinitely. This is denoted as $(-\infty, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \leq b\}$ if we want all numbers less or equal than $b$, or $(a, \infty) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x > a\}$ if we want all numbers greater than $a$. We can also have intervals that are unbounded on both sides, such as $(-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$.

    Note that the endpoints of the interval that is included is always the one with the square bracket if it is excluded it is the one with the round bracket. In some literature you might also see square brackets facing outwards for the open interval rather than round brackets. This is just a different notation and means the same thing.

    For example, $[a, b)$ includes $a$ but not $b$, while $(a, b]$ includes $b$ but not $a$ and $]a, b[$  is the equivalent of $(a, b)$ in some literature. 

    Also, note that the unbounded side with $\infty$ is always excluded i.e. uses the round bracket. This is because infinity is not a real number and the interval is a set of real numbers so it can't include infinity. This also means that the interval $(-\infty, \infty)$ is the set of all real numbers so $\mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)$ and that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $-\infty < x < \infty$.

    This also has one small consequence which I personally do not like. We said that a closed interval includes both endpoints. But if we have an unbounded interval such as $(-\infty, b]$ then it only includes one endpoint as infinity is not a real number and can not be included. However, we say that the following forms of intervals are closed intervals: 

    1. $[a, b], a \leq b \in \mathbb{R}$
    2. $[a, +\infty), a \in \mathbb{R}$
    3. $(-\infty, b], b \in \mathbb{R}$
    4. $(-\infty, +\infty)$

    My personal interpretation of this is that the "closed" intervals with infinity are closed in the sense that they are as closed as they can be, except for the infinity part. So no matter which real number you would then pick as an endpoint, it would be included in the interval. But this is just my personal interpretation and not a formal definition and as noted I find this not very intuitive.

    There is a more logical explanation to this when talking about the [Balzano-Weierstrass theorem](/garden/maths/calculus/sequencesAndSeries/convergentSequences#bolzano-weierstrass-theorem) which states that an Interval is closed if for any sequence containing elements of the interval, the limit of that sequence is also in the interval. So if we have an unbounded interval such as $(-\infty, b]$ then we can always find a sequence such as the constant 
    sequence $a_n = b$ that converges to $b$ and is in the interval. The same goes for the interval $(-\infty, +\infty)$ which is the set of all real numbers. So we can always find a sequence that converges to some real number in the interval.

    - $(2, 5)$ is the set of all real numbers between 2 and 5, but not including 2 and 5.
    - $[3, 7]$ is the set of all real numbers between 3 and 7, including 3 and 7.
    - $(-\infty, 4]$ is the set of all real numbers less than or equal to 4.
    - $(6, \infty)$ is the set of all real numbers greater than 6.

## Bounds

If we have a set of real numbers $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we can define the following terms:

- **Upper bound**: A real number $c$ is an upper bound of $A$ if $\forall a \in A: a \leq c$. In other words, $c$ is greater than or equal to all elements of $A$. We then say that $A$ is bounded above.
- **Lower bound**: A real number $c$ is a lower bound of $A$ if $\forall a \in A: a \geq c$. In other words, $c$ is less than or equal to all elements of $A$. We then say that $A$ is bounded below.

Important to note is that the upper and lower bounds can be elements of the set $A$ itself but they can also be real numbers that are not in the set. If a set has both an upper and lower bound it is called bounded. If it only has one of the two it is called half-bounded, i.e bounded above or bounded below where the other bound is either $-\infty$ or $\infty$. An alternative definition is to say that the set $A$ is bounded if there exists a real number $c > 0$ such that:

```math
\forall a \in A: |a| \leq c
```

### Maximum and Minimum of a Set

We can now also define the operations of maximum and minimum for two numbers $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ as:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{max}(a, b) & = \begin{cases} a & \text{if } a \geq b \\ b & \text{if } b \geq a \end{cases} \\
\text{min}(a, b) & = \begin{cases} a & \text{if } a \leq b \\ b & \text{if } b \leq a \end{cases}
\end{align*}
```

This then also leads to another definition of the [absolute value](/garden/maths/commonFunctions/absolute) of a real number $x$ as:

```math
|x| = \text{max}(x, -x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}
```

With our knowledge of intervals and bounds, we can now also extend the definition of the maximum and minimum to sets of real numbers. We can define the maximum and minimum of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ as:

- **Maximum**: A real number $c$ is the maximum of $A$ if it is an upper bound of $A$ so $\forall a \in A: a \leq c$ and $c \in A$. We then write $\text{max}(A) = c$.
- **Minimum**: A real number $c$ is the minimum of $A$ if it is a lower bound of $A$ so $\forall a \in A: a \geq c$ and $c \in A$. We then write $\text{min}(A) = c$.

Not all sets have a maximum or minimum also if the set is upper or lower bounded. 

<Callout type="example">
The interval $[1, \infty)$ has a lower bound but is unbounded above. So it has a minimum but no maximum. The minimum is $1$ and the maximum does not exist.

The interval $(-1, 1)$ has no upper or lower bound. Therefore it also has no maximum or minimum.

Lastly the interval $(1, \infty)$ has a lower bound of $1$ but is unbounded above. However, it does not have a minimum or maximum. To show that there is no maximum is trivial, but to show that there is no minimum we can do the following:

For there to be a minimum, there must be a real number $c$ such that $\forall x \in (1, \infty): x \geq c$. If we take any element $b \in (1, \infty)$ then we can take the value in between $1$ and $b$ such as $c = \frac{1 + b}{2}$. This value is still in the interval $(1, \infty)$ but because $b$ was arbitrary, we can always find a value in the interval that is smaller than $c$. Therefore there is no minimum.

An alternative way to think about this is if we look at the set of the lower bounds of the interval $(1, \infty)$ which is $(-\infty, 1]$. This set has maximum $1$ but no minimum. So the interval $(1, \infty)$ has no minimum.

### Supremum and Infimum

If we know an upper or lower bound of a set then all values that are greater or equal to the upper bound or smaller or equal to the lower bound are also bounds. But what if we wanted to find the closest bound to the set that is still a bound? This is where the supremum and infimum come in. We can define the supremum and infimum of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $A \neq \emptyset$ as:

- **Supremum**: A real number $c$ is the supremum of $A$ if it is the smallest upper bound of $A$. In other words, $c$ is an upper bound of $A$ and if $d$ is another upper bound of $A$ then $c \leq d$. We then write $\sup A = c$.
- **Infimum**: A real number $c$ is the infimum of $A$ if it is the largest lower bound of $A$. In other words, $c$ is a lower bound of $A$ and if $d$ is another lower bound of $A$ then $c \geq d$. We then write $\inf A = c$.

So if a set has a maximum then the supremum is the same as the maximum and if a set has a minimum then the infimum is the same as the minimum. 

<Callout type="example">
Let $A = \{\frac{2x}{x+3} \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } x > 0\}$. 

Then we first check the bounds. Because $x > 0$ we can see the following for all $x \in A$. 

```math
\frac{2x}{x+3} \geq 0
```

So $0$ is a lower bound of $A$. We can rearrange the expression to find the upper bound:

```math
\frac{2x}{x+3} = \frac{2x}{x(1 + \frac{3}{x})} = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{3}{x}} < 2
```

So $2$ is an upper bound of $A$. Now the question is, is 2 the supremum, so is it the smallest upper bound? Let's assume that there is a smaller upper bound $c$ so that $c < 2$. Then we have:

```math
\begin{align*}
0 < \frac{2x}{x+3} & \leq c \\
2x & \leq c(x + 3) \\
2x & \leq cx + 3c \\
2x - cx & \leq 3c \\
(2 - c)x & \leq 3c 
\end{align*}
```

If we then set $x = \frac{4c}{2 - c}$, we can see that this is a valid value for $x$. This then leads to:

```math
\begin{align*}
(2 - c)\frac{4c}{2 - c} & \leq 3c \\
4c & \leq 3c 
\end{align*}
```

This is a contradiction because $c > 0$ and therefore $4c \leq 3c$ can not hold. So there can not be a smaller upper bound than $2$. Therefore, $2$ is the supremum of $A$. An alternative way and possibly more intuitive way to prove that $2$ is the supremum is that we must show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $x \in A$ such that:

```math
2 - \epsilon < \frac{2x}{x+3} < 2
```

The right side is trivial as we already know that $2$ is an upper bound. For the left side, we can rearrange the expression to find:

```math
\begin{align*}
2 - \epsilon & < \frac{2x}{x+3} \\
(2 - \epsilon)(x + 3) & < 2x \\
(2 - \epsilon)x + 3(2 - \epsilon) & < 2x \\
(2 - \epsilon)x + 6 - 3\epsilon & < 2x \\
(2 - \epsilon)x - 2x & < -6 + 3\epsilon \\
(2 - \epsilon - 2)x & < -6 + 3\epsilon \\
(-\epsilon)x & < -6 + 3\epsilon \\
x & > \frac{-6 + 3\epsilon}{-\epsilon} \\
x & > \frac{6 - 3\epsilon}{\epsilon} \\
x & > \frac{6}{\epsilon} - 3
\end{align*}
```

Because $x > 0$ it also has to hold that $\frac{6}{\epsilon} - 3 > 0$ which is true for small enough $\epsilon > 0$. So we can always find an $x \in A$ such that $2 - \epsilon < \frac{2x}{x+3} < 2$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Therefore, $2$ is the supremum of $A$.

Is $2$ also the maximum of $A$? To check this we can see if $2 \in A$. So we need to find an $x \leq 0$ such that:

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{2x}{x+3} & = 2 \\
2x & = 2(x + 3) \\
2x & = 2x + 6 \\
0 & = 6
\end{align*}
```

This is a contradiction, so $2$ is not in $A$. Therefore, $2$ is not the maximum of $A$ but it is the supremum of $A$.

The last part is to find the infimum of $A$. We already know that $0$ is a lower bound of $A$ the question is if there exists a larger lower bound than $0$. If we assume that there is a larger lower bound $c > 0$ then we can rearrange the expression to find:

```math
\begin{align*}
c \leq \frac{2x}{x+3} \\
c (x + 3) & \leq 2x \\
c x + 3c & \leq 2x \\
3c & \leq 2x - c x \\
3c & \leq x(2 - c)
\end{align*}
```

If we then set $x = \frac{2c}{2 - c}$, we can see that this is a valid value for $x$. This then leads to:

```math
\begin{align*}
3c & \leq \frac{2c(2 - c)}{2 - c} \\
3c & \leq 2c
\end{align*}
```

This is a contradiction because $c > 0$ and therefore $3c \leq 2c$ can not hold. So there can not be a larger lower bound than $0$. Therefore, $0$ is the infimum of $A$. An alternative way to prove that $0$ is the infimum is that we must show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $x \in A$ such that:

```math
0 < \frac{2x}{x+3} < \epsilon
```

The left side is trivial as we already know that $0$ is a lower bound. For the right side, we can rearrange the expression to find:

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{2x}{x+3} & < \epsilon \\
2x & < \epsilon(x + 3) \\
2x & < \epsilon x + 3\epsilon \\
2x - \epsilon x & < 3\epsilon \\
(2 - \epsilon)x & < 3\epsilon \\
x & < \frac{3\epsilon}{2 - \epsilon}
\end{align*}
```

Since $0 < \epsilon < 2 - \epsilon$ as we want $x$ to be positive, we can always find an $x \in A$ such that $0 < \frac{2x}{x+3} < \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Therefore, $0$ is the infimum of $A$.

Is $0$ also the minimum of $A$? To check this we can see if $0 \in A$. So we need to find an $x > 0$ such that:

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{2x}{x+3} & = 0 \\
2x & = 0(x + 3) \\
2x & = 0 \\
x & = 0
\end{align*}
```

This is a contradiction, as $x$ must be greater than $0$. So $0$ is not in $A$. Therefore, $0$ is not the minimum of $A$ but it is the infimum of $A$.
</Callout>

We can also describe the set of all upper or lower bounds of a set $A$ as:

```math
\begin{align*}
\text{Upper bounds of } A & = \{c \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall a \in A: a \leq c\} = [\sup(A), \infty\} \\
\text{Lower bounds of } A & = \{c \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall a \in A: a \geq c\} = [\inf(A), -\infty\}
\end{align*}
```

If $A \subseteq B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ then:

- If $B$ is bounded above then $\sup A \leq \sup B$.
- If $B$ is bounded below then $\inf A \geq \inf B$.

### Compact Intervals

The idea of a compact interval is that we want an interval that doesn't have any "gaps" or missing endpoints. This is closely related to the concept of closed intervals and bounded sets. In real analysis, a set is called compact if it is both closed and bounded. So an Inteval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is called compact if it has the following form:

```math
I = [a, b] \text{ with } a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a \leq b
```

So in other words, a compact interval is a closed interval with real endpoints. 

<Callout type="example">
    Examples of compact intervals:
    - $[0, 1]$ is a compact interval because it is closed and bounded.
    - $[-5, 5]$ is a compact interval because it is closed and bounded.
    - $[2, 3]$ is a compact interval because it is closed and bounded.
    
    Examples of non-compact intervals:
    - $(0, 1)$ is not a compact interval because it is not closed.
    - $(-\infty, 0]$ is not a compact interval because it is not bounded.
    - $[0, \infty)$ is not a compact interval because it is not bounded.
