# Power Series

A power series is a more general mathematical concept, and the Taylor series is a specific type of power series. 

A power series is a series of the form:

```math
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x - c)^n
```

where $a_n$ are the coefficients, $c$ is the center of the series, and $x$ is the variable.
This series represents a function of $x$ in terms of powers of $(x - c)$. The 
higher the power of $(x - c)$, the more accurate the approximation of the function around the point $x = c$.
