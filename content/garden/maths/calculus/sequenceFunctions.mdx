# Sequences of Functions

We know a sequence is a function that maps natural numbers to real or complex numbers. But we can also define a sequence of functions and therefore a sequence of sequences. 

Some weird complicated stuff.

This leads to us being able to swap the limit and the sum signs under some condition?

This is then used to prove that the exponential series converges to $e^z$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$.

## Convergence of Function Sequences

This is all a bit weird and she uses this stuff to define the trigonometric functions?

### Pointwise Convergence

### Uniform Convergence

She later on also shows a third type?

### Normal Convergence

Is this the third type?

## Removable Discontinuity

A function $f$ has a **removable discontinuity** at $x_0$ if the limit $\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x)$ exists (from both sides), but $f(x_0)$ is either not defined or not equal to this limit. In other words, the discontinuity can be "removed" by redefining $f(x_0)$ to be this limit. So if for every sequence $a_n \to x_0$, $a_n \neq x_0$, we have $f(a_n) \to L$, but $f(x_0) \neq L$, then $x_0$ is a removable discontinuity. Formally, if

```math
\lim_{x \to x_0^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to x_0^+} f(x) = L
```

but $f(x_0) \neq L$ or $f(x_0)$ is undefined, we can define a new function

```math
\hat{f}(x) = \begin{cases}
f(x), & x \neq x_0 \\
L, & x = x_0
\end{cases}
```

which is now continuous at $x_0$.

<Callout type="example">
Suppose we have a function defined as follows:

```math
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}, & x \neq 1 \\
3, & x = 1
\end{cases}
```

For $x \neq 1$, $f(x) = x + 1$, so as $x \to 1$, $f(x) \to 2$. But $f(1) = 3 \neq 2$.  
So, $f$ has a removable discontinuity at $x_0 = 1$. If we redefine $f(1) := 2$, the function becomes continuous at $x_0 = 1$. So the new continuous function $\hat{f}(x)$ is:

```math
\hat{f}(x) = \begin{cases}
f(x), & x \neq 1 \\
2, & x = 1
\end{cases}
```

Take $a_n = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$, then $a_n \to 1$, and $f(a_n) = a_n + 1 \to 2$ as $n \to \infty$.  
But $f(1) = 3$, so $f(a_n) \to 2 \neq f(1)$.  
Thus, $f$ is not continuous at $x_0 = 1$, but redefining $f(1) := 2$ “removes” the discontinuity.
