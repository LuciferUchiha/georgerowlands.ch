# Exponents and Logarithms

<Callout type="todo">
This is just a rough summary of all the exponent and logarithm properties. Most of these are actually defined in calculus can are also derived there.

$a$ to the power of 1 is therefore just simply $a$.

```math
a^0 = 1 \quad \text{for all } a \neq 0
```

Depending on the context, $0^0$ can be defined as 1 or undefined.

```math
a^b \cdot a^c = a^{b+c}
```

```math
(ab)^c = a^b \cdot b^c
```

```math
(a^b)^c = a^{b \cdot c} 
```

```math
\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}
```

```math
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^c = \frac{a^c}{b^c}
```

```math
a^{\frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[c]{a^b}
```

```math
a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}
```

## Logarithms

> The logarithm of $b$ with base $a$ is the power to which $a$ must be raised to obtain $b$, so answers the question of 
"$a$ to the power of what gives $b$?"

This is why the logarithm is only defined for a positive base $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1$, and a positive argument $b > 0$.

```math
\log_a{b} = c \iff a^c = b
```

```math
\log_a{a} = 1
```

```math
\log_a{a^b} = b
```

Because of this, the logarithm of 1 with any base is 0.

```math
\log_a{1} = 0
```

```math
\log_a{b \cdot c} = \log_a{b} + \log_a{c}
```

```math
\log_a{\frac{b}{c}} = \log_a{b} - \log_a{c}
```

```math
\log_a{b^c} = c \cdot \log_a{b}
```

```math
- \log_a{b} = \log_a{\frac{1}{b}}
```

Change of base formula:

```math
\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}
```

```math
\log_a{b} \cdot \log_c{a} = \log_c{b}
```

```math
\log_a{b} = \frac{1}{\log_b{a}}
```

```math
a^{\log_a{b}} = b
```

```math
\log_{a^b}{c} = \frac{1}{b} \cdot \log_a{c}
```

```math
\log_{a^b}{c^d} = \frac{d}{b} \cdot \log_a{c}
```
