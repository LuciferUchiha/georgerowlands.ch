# Binomial Coefficient

The binomial coefficient is a function that often appears in various areas of maths but especially 
in combinatorics and probability theory.

The formula for a binomial coefficient, or simply a binom, is defined as:

```math
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
```

Where $n$ and $k$ are non-negative integers and $n!$ is the [factorial](/garden/maths/commonFunctions/factorial) of $n$.

When $k$ is $0$ the binomial coefficient resolves to $1$:

```math
\binom{n}{0} = \frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
```

When $k$ is equal to $n$ the binomial coefficient also resolves to $1$:

```math
\binom{n}{n} = \frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
```

When calculating binomials by hand, it is often helpful to simplify the calculation by canceling out terms in the 
factorials. 

<Callout type="example">
```math
\begin{align*}
\binom{5}{2} &= \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5*4*3*2*1}{2*1*3*2*1} = \frac{5*4}{2*1} = 10 \\
\binom{12}{5} &= \frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = 792 \\
\binom{7}{1} &= \frac{7!}{1!(7-1)!} = 7
\end{align*}
```

## Vandermonde's Identity

Vandermonde's identity is a combinatorial identity that relates binomial coefficients. It states that:

```math
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{m}{i} \binom{n}{k-i} = \binom{m+n}{k}
``` 

## For Probability

</Callout>

In probability theory, a binomial indicates how many ways you can choose $k$ objects from a set of $n$ different objects
(without replacement and without regard to order). Formally, the binomial coefficient is the number of $k$-element
subsets of an $n$-element set.

On calculators, you often find the English abbreviation "nCr", which stands for "n choose r" and corresponds to the binomial.

## For Binomial Terms

A binomial term has the following form:

```math
(x + y)^n , n \in \mathbb{N}
```

The binomial coefficients give the coefficients of the expansion of a binomial term. This is done using the following formula:

```math
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k}
```

This is also known as the **binomial theorem**. 

<Callout type="example">
```math
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^3 &= \binom{3}{0} x^{3} + \binom{3}{1} x^{2}y + \binom{3}{2} xy^{2} + \binom{3}{3} y^{3} \\
&=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+y^3
\end{align*}
```

## Pascal's Triangle

The Pascal's triangle is a graphical representation of binomial coefficients, which also simplifies calculation.
Here, a triangle is drawn where the upper variable $n$ of the binomial coefficient corresponds to the row index and the
lower variable $k$ corresponds to the column index.

/>

The calculation of the values is then very simple. First, for all elements at the edge of the triangle, you set a 1,
because a binom with 0 or n as the lower variable resolves to 1. Then, every other value is the sum of the values
directly above it.

This derivation comes from the equation:

```math
\binom{n+1}{k+1}=\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1}
```

We will take the value in the middle of the third row of the image above.

```math
\begin{align*}
\binom{2}{1} &= \binom{1}{0} + \binom{1}{1} \\
\frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} &= \frac{1!}{0!(1-0)!} +
\frac{1!}{1!(1-1)!} \\
\frac{2}{1!1!} &= \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{1!0!} \\
\frac{2}{1} &= \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} \\
2 &= 1 + 1
\end{align*}
