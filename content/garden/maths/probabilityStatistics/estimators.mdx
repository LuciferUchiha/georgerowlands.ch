# Estimators

The idea of statistics is collect, organize, analyze and interpret data. Estimators are a key concept in statistics as they provide a way to estimate how the collected data relates to the larger population from which it was drawn. Based on these estimation certain properties or behaviors of the population can be inferred. 

The idea of estimators is that have some sort of observed data points and we now want to analyze these points to make inferences about the underlying mechanism that generated the data. So we start by having some sort of dataset with data points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$. This collection/dataset of observations/data points is also referred to as a **sample** and the number of observations in the sample $n$ is referred to as the **sample size**. 

The first step we commonly do with the sample is to present the data visually in a meaningful way, such as through graphs or charts, to identify patterns or trends. This is so-called **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and falls under **descriptive statistics**.

The second step is where our estimators come into play. The idea is that the data points are generated by some [random variables]() $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ which are drawn from some underlying distribution. This distribution is also referred to as the **population distribution** or just simply **model**. This model is parameterized by some unknown parameters $\theta$ from the **parameter space** $\Theta$ along with a probability measure $P_\theta$. Notice that our model is a [joint distribution]() over the random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$. The reason for this is that there can be dependencies between the random variables, meaning the value of one variable can influence the value of another. However, we can also consider the case where the random variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), in which case the joint distribution can be factored into the product of the individual distributions.

We know somehow want to use the sample data to estimate the parameters of the model such that they are as close as possible to the true parameters. This is what the **estimators** are for, to find the parameters $\theta$. These are of course simplifications/abstractions of the real-world processes that generated the data as the real-world is to complex. However, we can imagine that nature or god whichever you prefer has some underlying mechanism that picked $\theta$ and $P_\theta$ and was responsible for generating the observed data points.

So our process is as follows:
1. Collect sample data points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns or trends.
3. Assume each $X_i$ is a realisation of a random variable with common distribution $P_\theta$ indexed by an unknown parameter (or vector) $\theta\in\Theta$.
4. Define the [probability space]() $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P_\theta)$ where $\Omega$ is the sample space, $\mathcal{F}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra and for each parameter selection $\theta \in \Theta$, $P_\theta$ is the probability measure.
5. Based on the defined model and the observed data, we can now construct our estimators for the unknown parameters $\theta$.
6. Evaluate the performance of the chosen parameters $\theta$ and model $P_\theta$ to check if they fit the observed data well using [statistical tests]().
7. Rather than choosing one set of parameters $\theta$, we can also choose a region in the parameter space $\Theta$ such that the probability that they match the observed data is maximized. These regions are often referred to as [confidence intervals]().

So we have seen that the idea is that estimators are mathematical tools used to make inferences about unknown parameters $\theta$ for a chosen model family $(P_\theta)_{\theta \in \Theta}$ using observed data. So given a sample of random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ we formally define an estimator also as a random Variable:

```math
\begin{align*}
T: \Omega \to \mathbb{R} \\
T = t(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)
\end{align*}
```

where $T$ is the estimator. The estimator is like a rule or formula that tells us how to use our data $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ to estimate the unknown parameter $\theta$. The function $t: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function that once we observe data $x_i = X_i(\omega)$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$, we can use it to compute the estimate $\hat{\theta} = t(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ which is some value in $\mathbb{R}$ and our guess for the unknown parameter $\theta$.

<Callout type="example" title="Tea Tasting Lady">
Just like with making cereal where you can either first put in the milk and then the cereal, or the other way around (there is only one good way), there are two ways you can make an english tea, either by first pouring in the milk or the tea (again as a brit there is only one good way). So we define the following ways to make tea:

- **Type 1**: Pour the milk first, then add tea.
- **Type 2**: Pour the tea first, then add milk.

Now an old british lady (think of the Queen with her dogs) claims that she can taste the difference and can tell which method was used just by sipping the tea. To test her claim, we conduct a blind taste test over $n$ days where she is given 2 cups of tea, one made with each method, and asked to identify which cup is type 1, so where the milk was poured first. We record her responses, where 1 indicates a correct classification and 0 an incorrect classification:

```math
x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \{0, 1\}
```

We treat this sample of responses as a realization of the random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$. For our model it naturally follows that we could think of each day as a Bernoulli trial, where the lady has an unknown success probability $\theta$ of correctly identifying the tea type. This $\theta$ is our parameter that we want to find and is what defines our model $P_\theta$. So we could assume that $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ and that each trial is i.i.d. Then we can get the random number of correct classifications by summing the observations so we get:

```math
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
```

And because $X_i \text{ are i.i.d. } \text{Bernoulli}(p)$, we would have:

```math
S_n \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)
```

We can also define the actual observed number of correct classifications as:

```math
s_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
```

Based on our chosen family of models we could now construct some estimators to find the unknown parameter $\theta$. A possible estimator could be a **last observation estimator** which just takes the last observation:

```math
T^{(1)} = X_n
```

for our observed data, this would give us the estimate 

```math
t^{(1)}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x_n
```

Another possible estimator could be a **sample mean estimator** which takes the average of all observations:

```math
T^{(2)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = \bar{X}_n
```

Because we see this averaged sum very often in statistics, we often denote the sample mean as $\bar{X}_n$. For our observed data, this would give us the estimate

```math
t^{(2)}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
```

As a concrete example, if we observed the following classifications:

```math
x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 1, x_4 = 1, x_5 = 0
```

Then our estimates would be:

```math
t^{(1)}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x_n = 0
```

which is equivalent to the true success probability never being correct and for the sample mean estimator we have:

```math
t^{(2)}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = \frac{1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0}{5} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
```

Meaning our estimate for the true success probability $\theta$ is 0.6.
</Callout>
<Callout type="example" title="Average Student Height">
Suppose we want to estimate the **average height** of all students at a university. We can't measure every student, so we randomly sample $n$ students and measure their heights. Let’s denote their measured heights as:

```math
x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}
```

We treat this sample as a realization of random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$.

For our model, let's assume that heights are normally distributed with some unknown mean $\theta$ (which we want to estimate), but a known variance $\sigma^2$:

```math
X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta, \sigma^2), \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
```

with each $X_i$ being i.i.d.

The parameter $\theta$ here represents the true average (mean) height in the student population, and this is the parameter of our model family $P_\theta$ that we want to estimate.

Again a natural estimator for $\theta$ could be the sample mean:

```math
T = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = \bar{X}_n
```

This is a random variable, since it depends on the random sample. For observed data, the estimate we compute is:

```math
t(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
```

So if we were to observe the following heights (in cm):

```math
x_1 = 170, x_2 = 172, x_3 = 168, x_4 = 174, x_5 = 176
```

then our estimate would be:

```math
t(170, 172, 168, 174, 176) = \frac{170 + 172 + 168 + 174 + 176}{5} = 172
```

So, based on this sample, our estimated average student height $\theta$ is 172 cm.
</Callout>

## Bias

Once we have constructed an estimator $T$ for our parameter of interest $\theta$, we want to know how good our estimator is. One way to assess this is by examining its **bias**. The bias of an estimator tells us whether our estimator systematically overestimates or underestimates the true parameter value. More formally, for any parameter value $\theta \in \Theta$, the bias of an estimator $T$ is defined as:

```math
\text{Bias}_{\theta}(T) = \mathbb{E}_\theta[T] - \theta
```

Here, $\mathbb{E}_\theta[T]$ is the expected value (average outcome) of $T$ under the assumption that the true parameter is $\theta$. If the bias is zero for all $\theta$, i.e.

```math
\text{Bias}_{\theta}(T) = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathbb{E}_\theta[T] = \theta \quad \forall \theta \in \Theta,
```

then $T$ is called **unbiased**. This means that if we were to repeat our data collection and estimation process over and over, on average, our estimator would return the true parameter value. If the bias is nonzero, then the estimator is **biased**. This means our estimator is systematically too high or too low, even on average.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

While bias tells us about the average "miss", it does not tell us about the **variability** of the estimator from sample to sample. For that, we use the **mean squared error** (MSE). The MSE is defined as:

```math
\text{MSE}_{\theta}(T) = \mathbb{E}_\theta[(T - \theta)^2]
```

This measures the average squared distance between our estimator and the true parameter. It is a way to combine both the **systematic error** (bias) and the **random error** (variance) into a single quantity. This allows us to rewrite the MSE as:

```math
\text{MSE}_{\theta}(T) = \mathbb{V}_\theta(T) + \text{Bias}_{\theta}(T)^2
```

Here, $\mathbb{V}_\theta(T)$ is the variance of the estimator $T$ under the model with parameter $\theta$.

<Callout type="info" title="MSE in Machine Learning">
The MSE you see here is exactly the same as the mean squared error that is often minimized in machine learning, for example when fitting a regression model. In both cases, the goal is to find a function or estimator that is as close as possible (on average) to the quantity we are trying to estimate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Tea Tasting Lady">
Let's revisit the tea tasting lady experiment, where each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $\theta$, and we want to estimate $\theta$ using two different estimators. Our first estimator is based on the last observation $T^{(1)} = X_n$. First we can calculate the expected value of our estimator:

```math
\E_\theta[T^{(1)}] = \E_\theta[X_n] = \theta
```

the expectation is that it is equal to the true parameter $\theta$ is because we have a Bernoulli random variable where the expected value is equal to the success probability. This means that for the bias we get:

```math
\text{Bias}_\theta(T^{(1)}) = \E_\theta[T^{(1)}] - \theta = \theta - \theta = 0
```

For the variance we can either use the variance definition and the fact that $X_n$ is a Bernoulli random variable or calculate it using the expectation trick:

```math
\V_\theta(T^{(1)}) = \V_\theta(X_n) = \theta(1 - \theta) \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbb{V}_\theta(T^{(1)}) = \E_\theta[(T^{(1)})^2] - \E_\theta[T^{(1)}]^2 = \theta - \theta^2 = \theta(1 - \theta)
```

We can then calculate the MSE as follows:

```math
\text{MSE}_\theta(T^{(1)}) = \E_\theta[(T^{(1)} - \theta)^2] = \V_\theta(T^{(1)}) + \text{Bias}_\theta(T^{(1)})^2 = \theta(1 - \theta) + 0 = \theta(1 - \theta)
```

Now let's look at the second estimator, the sample mean $T^{(2)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. Again we can calculate the expected value:

```math
\mathbb{E}_\theta[T^{(2)}] = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta[X_i] = \frac{1}{n} n \theta = \theta
```

This means that the bias is again zero:

```math
\text{Bias}_\theta(T^{(2)}) = \E_\theta[T^{(2)}] - \theta = \theta - \theta = 0
```

However, the variance of the two estimators is different:

```math
\V_\theta(T^{(2)}) = \V_\theta\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\right) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \V_\theta(X_i) = \frac{1}{n^2} n \theta(1 - \theta) = \frac{1}{n} \theta(1 - \theta)
```

This also results in the MSE being different:

```math
\text{MSE}_{\theta}(T^{(2)}) = \E_\theta[(T^{(2)} - \theta)^2] = \V_\theta(T^{(2)}) + \text{Bias}_\theta(T^{(2)})^2 = \frac{1}{n} \theta(1 - \theta) + 0 = \frac{1}{n} \theta(1 - \theta)
```

Both estimators are unbiased because their bias is zero, but they have different variances and therefore different MSEs. Because the sample mean estimator $T^{(2)}$ uses all the data, and so its variance (and MSE) is much smaller than that of the estimator that uses only the last observation $T^{(1)}$. We could interpret this as the estimator extracting more information from the data as it incorporates all available observations, rather than just the last one. 

This means that, even though both estimators are correct on average, the sample mean estimator is much more reliable and concentrated around the true value. Especially as the sample size increases, the variance and the MSE of the sample mean estimator tends to zero which implies that it becomes a very good estimator for the true parameter $\theta$.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

The **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** method is a powerful and widely used technique in statistics for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. It is based on the principle of **likelihood**, which measures how well a particular set of parameters explains the observed data. The ML-method (where “ML” for once doesn't mean machine learning but maximum likelihood!) is a **systematic approach to constructing estimators** that are often very good and have desirable properties. The idea is to choose parameter values that make the observed data as "likely" as possible, according to our chosen model family.

Suppose we have collected a sample of data points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, which we treat as a realization of random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$. As before, we assume these are **i.i.d.** random variables, each distributed according to some family $P_\theta$, parameterized by the unknown $\theta \in \Theta$.

We define the **likelihood function** as the joint probability of the observed data given the parameter $\theta$:

```math
\L(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = \begin{cases}
\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{X_i}(x_i; \theta) & \text{if } X_i \text{ are discrete} \\
\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{X_i}(x_i; \theta) & \text{if } X_i \text{ are continuous}
\end{cases}
```

where $p_{X_i}(x_i; \theta)$ is the probability mass function (pmf) for the discrete case, and $f_{X_i}(x_i; \theta)$ is the probability density function (pdf) for the continuous case. As mentioned earlier, the likelihood function tells us what is the probability of the observed data given a specific parameter value. 

<Callout type="info" title="Probability vs Likelihood">
In normal conversations, people often use the terms "probability" and "likelihood" interchangeably, but in statistics and probability theory, they have distinct meanings:

- **Probability** answers: *Given* $\theta$, what is the probability of seeing $x\_1, \ldots, x\_n$? So $P(x\_1, \ldots, x\_n \mid \theta)$: varies $x\_i$, fixed $\theta$ (Function of the data, parameter fixed).
- **Likelihood** answers: *Given* the observed $x\_1, \ldots, x\_n$, how plausible is each possible $\theta$? So $\L(x\_1, \ldots, x\_n; \theta)$ varies $\theta$, fixed $x\_i$ (Function of the parameter, data fixed).

The formulas look identical, but the perspective is reversed!
</Callout>

The **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** of $\theta$ simply gives us the value of the parameter that maximizes the likelihood function:

```math
\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \L(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n; \theta)
```

Here, $\hat{\theta}$ is a number (or vector) which is our best guess for the true parameter based on the observed data. So the formula above gives you the *estimate* for a particular sample. If you replace the data with random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, you get the **MLE estimator** as a function:

```math
T_{ML} = t_{ML}(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)
```

So before you see the data, the estimator itself is a random variable (just like the sample mean). After you see the data, you plug in $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ to get your estimate $\hat{\theta}$.


<Callout type="example" title="Probability vs Likelihood">
Suppose we have a coin that we suspect might be biased, and we want to estimate its probability of landing heads, which we'll call $\theta$. We toss the coin three times and observe the outcomes:

```math
x_1 = 1, \quad x_2 = 0, \quad x_3 = 1
```

where $1$ denotes heads and $0$ denotes tails. The **sample space** for three tosses is all $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations, such as $(1,1,1)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, etc. So for our model we have for each toss $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$, with $\theta$ the probability of heads.

Suppose we want to calculate the probability of getting the specific sequence $(1, 0, 1)$, given a fair coin so $\theta = 0.5$ we get:

```math
P(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 1 \mid \theta = 0.5)
= 0.5^1 \times 0.5^1 \times 0.5^1
= 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125
```

So, the **probability** answers: *"How likely is it to see this specific data sequence, if we know $\theta$?"*

Now, imagine you have observed the sequence $(1, 0, 1)$. You want to know: *"For different possible values of $\theta$, how plausible is it that $\theta$ generated this data?"*

The likelihood function is:

```math
\begin{align*}
\L(1, 0, 1; \theta) = \theta^{x_1} (1-\theta)^{1-x_1} \cdot \theta^{x_2} (1-\theta)^{1-x_2} \cdot \theta^{x_3} (1-\theta)^{1-x_3} \\
= \theta^1 (1-\theta)^0 \cdot \theta^0 (1-\theta)^1 \cdot \theta^1 (1-\theta)^0
= \theta^2 (1-\theta)^1
\end{align*}
```

So if we then evaluate the likelihood for different values of $\theta$:

- If $\theta = 0.5$: $\L(1,0,1; 0.5) = (0.5)^2 \times (0.5)^1 = 0.125$
- If $\theta = 0.7$: $\L(1,0,1; 0.7) = (0.7)^2 \times (0.3)^1 = 0.147$
- If $\theta = 0.9$: $\L(1,0,1; 0.9) = (0.9)^2 \times (0.1)^1 = 0.081$

The likelihood is not a probability, but it tells us how "plausible" each value of $\theta$ is given the observed data. Here, $\theta = 0.7$ gives the highest likelihood for this observed sequence.

You can imagine plotting $\L(1,0,1;\theta)$ as a function of $\theta$ between $0$ and $1$: the peak of this plot is then the **maximum likelihood estimation**.
</Callout>

In practice, it is much easier and more popular to maximize the **log-likelihood function** which is why most of the time we only speak about it. The log-likelihood is given by:

```math
\ell(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = \log \L(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n; \theta)
```

The log-likelihood function has the advantage that the log function turns products into sums, which are numerically more stable and much easier to differentiate and optimize, especially for large $n$. Differentiating is key as to find the maximum, you usually set the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\theta$ to zero and solve for $\theta$.

<Callout type="info" title="MLE in Machine Learning">
Maximizing the log-likelihood is fundamental in many machine learning algorithms. For example, fitting a logistic regression model. However, finding the parameters for a high-dimensional model can be challenging, which is why we often use optimization techniques like gradient descent.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example" title="Tea Tasting Lady">
Let's return to the tea tasting lady. We recall that each $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$, $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and that we have the observed outcomes $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in {0, 1}$. We can then define the model for a single observation:

```math
p_{X_i}(x_i; \theta) = \theta^{x_i} (1-\theta)^{1-x_i}
```

The joint likelihood for the entire sample is then:

```math
\L(x_1, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \theta^{x_i} (1-\theta)^{1-x_i} = \theta^{s_n} (1-\theta)^{n-s_n}
```

where $s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is the total number of correct identifications. As mentioned taking the log simplifies the optimization problem:

```math
\ell(x_1, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = \log \L(x_1, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = s_n \log \theta + (n - s_n) \log (1 - \theta)
```

Note that here we use the following logarithm property:

```math
\log(ab) = \log a + \log b \quad \text{ and } \quad \log(a^b) = b \log a
```

To find the maximum we set the derivative with respect to $\theta$ to zero:

```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \ell(x_1, \ldots, x_n; \theta) = s_n \frac{1}{\theta} - (n - s_n) \frac{1}{1 - \theta} = \frac{s_n}{\theta} - \frac{n - s_n}{1 - \theta} = 0
```

The terms $s_n$ and $n - s_n$ are simply constants when differentiating with respect to $\theta$ which is why they stay. If we then solve for $\theta$, we get:

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{s_n}{\theta} - \frac{n - s_n}{1 - \theta} &= 0 \\
\frac{s_n}{\theta} &= \frac{n - s_n}{1 - \theta} \\
s_n (1 - \theta) &= (n - s_n) \theta \\
s_n - s_n \theta &= n \theta - s_n \theta \\
s_n &= n\theta \\
\theta &= \frac{s_n}{n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\end{align*}
```

So the **maximum likelihood estimator** is simply the **sample mean**:

```math
T_{ML} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \bar{X}_n
```
 
For observed data, the estimate is

```math
\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
```

Notice how taking the log made differentiation and solving for the maximum straightforward—otherwise, you'd be working with the product rule and much messier algebra.

## Estimating Multiple Parameters

So far we have seen cases where we have stochastic model with a single parameter $\theta \in \RR$ such as the success probability of a Bernoulli random variable. However, in many cases we want more complex models with multiple parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_m$ for $m \geq 2$ such as the normal distribution parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ simultaneously. In general we extend our parameter space to include all of these parameters:

```math
(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_k) \in \Theta \subseteq \RR^m
```

All of our previous definitions of estimators, bias, etc. still hold? Is it then just vector operations? Mabye show some this stuff.

<Callout type="example" title="Estimating Multiple Parameters">
We want to estimate the parameters $\theta=(\mu, \sigma^2)$ or simply $\theta=(\mu, std)$ of a normal distribution simultaneously. We assume we have a sample of $n$ observations $x_i$ which are i.i.d. random variables $X_i$ drawn from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown variance $\sigma^2$ so:

```math
X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \text{ are i.i.d. } \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
```

The probability density function (PDF) for a normal distribution is given by:

```math
f_{X_i}(x_i; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
```

Because the observations are i.i.d., the joint likelihood function for the entire sample is the product of the individual PDFs:

```math
\L(x_1, \ldots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{X_i}(x_i; \mu, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
```

Taking the log of the likelihood function, we get the log-likelihood (maybe show in steps if anything complicated was done)

```math
?
```

To find the parameters $\theta=(\mu, \sigma^2)$ that maximize the log-likelihood, we can take partial derivatives with respect to $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ and set them to zero. Because we want the maximum we are looking for the global maximum. Normally this would be a bit more complicated as you would have to do some checks with the hessian or something to make sure we get the global maximum and not a local maximum or that it is concave i dont know. However for the gaussian we know that it is always concave.First we differentiate with respect to $\mu$:

```math
?
```

So we get the maximum likelihood estimator for $\mu$ as:

```math
T_{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = \bar{X}_n
```

and then if we place our observations we get the maximum likelihood estimate for $\mu$ as:

```math
\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
```

Which is simply the sample mean of the observed data. We can then do the same for $\sigma^2$. First we differentiate the log-likelihood with respect to $\sigma^2$:

Do all the same stuff as above with the workings out blablabla. Make it clear how we got to the below.

We then get the maximum likelihood estimator for $\sigma^2$ as:

```math
T_{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i)^2 - \bar{X}_n^2
```

We can actually also expand the square:

```math
\begin{align*}
T_{\sigma^2} &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2 \\
?
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i)^2 - \bar{X}_n^2
\end{align*}
```

and if we place our observations we get the maximum likelihood estimate for $\sigma^2$ as:

```math
\hat{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \hat{\mu})^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i)^2 - \hat{\mu}^2
```

This is the so called momentum estimator for $(\E[X], \V[X])$ for any model $P_\theta$ where $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d. random variables. However, it has the drawback that it is not unbiased for $(\E[X], \V[X])$ as it is biased for the variance. 

First show that the estimator for the mu is unbiased then that it is biased for sigma. Show the maths and workings out.

However, we can also derive an unbiased estimator by simply correcting the estimator for the variance as follows:

```math
T'_{\sigma^2} = S^2 = \frac{n}{n-1}T_{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2 
```

The estimator then becomes unbiased for the variance. Because the estimator is so commonly used, it is often referred to as the "empirical sample variance" and is denoted by $S^2$.
