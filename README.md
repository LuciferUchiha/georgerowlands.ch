# Nextra Garden

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit `localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

Run `pnpm build` to generate an optimized version of the application for production. The output is generated inside the `.next` folder. If you are deploying with Netlify make sure you have the [Next.js Plugin](https://app.netlify.com/teams/luciferuchiha/plugins/@netlify/plugin-nextjs/install) installed and add the [environment variable for pnpm support](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#pnpm-support).
