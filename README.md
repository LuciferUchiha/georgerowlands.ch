# George's Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden. This is a place where I write down my notes and share my knowledge on various topics. To learn more about digital gardens, check out the introductory page [What is a Digital Garden?](https://www.georgerowlands.ch/garden). Please also note that this page is a constant work in progress and I am continuously updating it with new content and that I am human (enhanced by AI) and can therefore make mistakes. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/georgerowlands/digital-garden).

To run the page first clone the repository and install the npm packages with:

```shell
npm i
```

To then start the application run:

```shell
npm run dev
```
