# What is a Series?

A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. 

If the sequence is finite then the series is finite. If the sequence is infinite then the series is infinite.

## Infinite Series

An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. If the sequence has the form:

$$
a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots
$$

then the series of the sequence is:

$$
S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \ldots = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
$$

## Partial Sums

The sum of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is called the $n$th partial sum. The $n$th partial sum of a sequence is denoted by $s_n$.

$$
s_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i
$$
