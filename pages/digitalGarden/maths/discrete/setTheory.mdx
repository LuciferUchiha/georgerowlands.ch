# Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects. To create a set you simply list the objects between curly brackets. The objects in a set are called **elements** or **members** of the set. 
The **order of the elements in the set is not important**, and **an element can only appear once in a set**. If an element appears more than once, it is considered only once in the set. 

<Callout type="example">
- The set of the first three positive numbers is $\{1,2,3\}$.
- The order doesn't matter, therefore, $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same as $\{3,1,2\}$.
- Each element can only appear once, so $\{1,2,2,3\}$ is the same as $\{1,2,3\}$.
</Callout>

However, a set doesn't have to contain numbers. A set also doesn't have to have a certain amount of elements it could also be infinite. This allows us to differentiate between **finite** and **infinite** sets.
A set can also have no elements at all, the so-called **empty set**, and is represented by the symbol $\emptyset$. You may also see the notation of $\{\}$ or $\phi$ (phi) for the empty set. However I will be using $\emptyset$.

<Callout type="example">
- The infinite set of all positive integers is $\{1,2,3,...\}$.
- The finite set of all colors in the rainbow is $\{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\}$.
- The set of the three primary colors is $\{red, green, blue\}$.
</Callout>

## Cardinality

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements/members in that set. The cardinality of the set $A = \{1,2,3\}$ is denoted by:

$$
|A| = 3
$$

Importantly repeated elementes are not counted, so $B=\{blue, white, red, blue, white\}$ then the cardinality of $B$ is still 3.

### Cardinality of the Empty Set

### Cardinality of Disjoint Sets

## Membership

To indicate that an element is a member of a set the symbol $\in$ is used. To indicate that an element is not a member of a set the symbol $\notin$ is used.

<Callout type="example">
If $A=\{a,b,c\}$ then:

- Is a member of the set: $a \in A$ or $a \in \{a,b,c\}$
- Is not a member of the set: $d \notin A$ or $d \notin \{a,b,c\}$
</Callout>

## Equality

Because sets are characterized by their elements, two sets are only equal if they have the exact same elements. More formally, two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and every element of $B$ is an element of $A$:

$$
A=B \iff \forall x(x \in A \iff x \in B)
$$

<Callout type="example">
- $\{1,2,3\} = \{3,2,1\}$ because the order of the elements doesn't matter.
- $\{1,2,3\} \neq \{1,2,3,4\}$ because the second set has an element that is not in the first set.
- $\{1,2,3\} = \{1,2,2,3\}$ because only the distinct elements are considered.
</Callout>

## Sub and Superset

$A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$. $B$ is then also the so-called **superset** of $A$. This is written as:

$$
A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)
$$

The superset relation is the opposite of the subset relation, so $B \supseteq A$. This is written as:

$$
B \supseteq A \iff A \subseteq B
$$

If $C$ is not a subset of $D$, then we write $C \nsubseteq D$, and if $D$ is not a superset of $C$, then we write $D \nsupseteq C$.

<Callout type="example">
- $\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$ because all elements of the first set are also in the second set.
- $\{1,2,3\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$ because all elements of the first set are also in the second set.
- $\{1,2,3\} \nsubseteq \{1,2\}$ because not all elements of the first set are in the second set.
- $\{1,2,3\} \supseteq \{1,2\}$ because all elements of the second set are also in the first set.
</Callout>

If the symbol $\subseteq$ is underlined, then the sets can also be equal.

If $A$ is a subset of $B$ but not equal to $B$, then $A$ is called a **proper subset** of $B$. 
The same goes for the superset relation, if $B$ is a superset of $A$ but not equal to $A$, then $B$ is called a **proper superset** of $A$.
However, a set is never a proper subset or superset of itself because it is equal to itself and can therefore not be a proper subset or superset.

$$
A \subset B \iff A \subseteq B \land A \neq B
$$

<Callout type="example">
- $\{1,2\} \subset \{1,2,3\}$ because all elements of the first set are also in the second set but the sets are not equal.
- $\{1,2,3\} \not \subset \{1,2,3\}$ because all elements of the first set are also in the second set and the sets are equal. Therefore it is not a proper subset but just a subset.
- $\{1,2,3\} \not \subset \{1,2\}$ because not all elements of the first set are in the second set.
- $\{1,2,3\} \supset \{1,2\}$ because all elements of the second set are also in the first set but the sets are not equal.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Because the empty set has no elements, it is a subset of every set, including itself. Therefore $\emptyset \subseteq A$ or $\emptyset \subset A$ for every set $A$.

- $\emptyset \subset \{1,2,3\}$
- $\emptyset \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$
- $\emptyset \subset \emptyset$
- $\emptyset \nsubseteq \emptyset$
</Callout>

## Venn Diagrams

When working with sets, it can be very helpful to visualize them with venn diagrams. The sets are usually represented by circles. By creating a venn diagram, you can easily see the relations between sets.

For example below we can visualize the difference between a subset and a proper subset.

## Defining a Set

There are multiple ways to define a set.

### Roster Notation

The roster or also called enumeration notation defines a set by listing its elements between curly brackets separated by commas. This is the most common way to define a set and is what I have been using in the examples above.

<Callout type="example">
- The set of the first three positive numbers is $\{1,2,3\}$.
- The set of the first three positive even numbers is $\{2,4,6\}$.
</Callout>

### Semantic Definition

Sets can be described semantically using words and rules. This notation is less preffered as it can be more confusing, unclear and ambiguous.

<Callout type="example">
Let $A$ be the first 3 positive integers that are odd. Therefore the set is then $A=\{1,3,5\}$
Let $B$ be the set of colors of the French flag. Therefore the set is then $B=\{blue,white,red\}$
</Callout>

### Set-Builder Notation

This is probably the hardest notation to understand. The set-builder notation specifies a set as a selection from a larger set, determined by a condition on those elements. It commonly uses the following form:

$$
\{x \mid P(x)\}
$$

Where $x$ is the variable, and $P(x)$ is the statement or condition that $x$ must satisfy to be an element of the set. The vertical bar "|" is read as "such that". So the description can be read as "the set of all elements $x$ such that $x$ satisfies $P(x)$".

<Callout type="example">
If we define the set $\Bbb{Z}$ as the set of all integers, then the set of all positive integers that are less than 5 can be defined as:

$$
F = \{ a \mid a \in \Bbb{Z} \text{ and } 0 \leq a \leq 5\}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}
$$

Another example is the set of all even numbers:

$$
E = \{ x \mid x \in \Bbb{Z} \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}=\{0,2,-2,4,-4,6,-6,...\}
$$

We could mathmatically define when a number is even:

$$
E = \{ x \mid x \in \Bbb{Z} \text{ and } \exists k \in \Bbb{Z} \text{ such that } x=2k\}
$$

</Callout>

## Sets of Numbers

The most common use of sets is to define the different types of numbers. The following are the most common sets of numbers and their notation:

- **Natural Numbers** $\Bbb{N}$: The set of positive integers. Depending on the author, this set can include 0 or not.
- **Integers** $\Bbb{Z}$: The set of positive and negative whole numbers, including zero.
- **Rational Numbers** $\Bbb{Q}$: The set of numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
- **Real Numbers** $\Bbb{R}$: The set of all rational and irrational numbers.
- **Complex Numbers** $\Bbb{C}$: The set of numbers that can be expressed in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

If we visualize these sets with a venn diagram, we can see how they are related to each other and are all subsets of each other.

$$
\Bbb{N} \subset \Bbb{Z} \subset \Bbb{Q} \subset \Bbb{R} \subset \Bbb{C}
$$

<Image 
    src="/maths/setsOfNumbers.png"
    caption="Venn diagram showing the all the sets of numbers."
    width={500}
/>

### Natural Numbers

The natural numbers are the set of positive integers. The set of natural numbers is denoted by:

$$
\Bbb{N} =\{0,1,2,3,...\}
$$

Depending on the author, 0 is included or not in the set of natural numbers. I prefer to include 0 in the set of natural numbers, as it makes more sense to me. This can cause confusion, so it is important to know some of the different notations used:

- If $\Bbb{N} =\{1,2,3,...\}$ then 0 is not included in the set of natural numbers. The authors that do not include 0 in the set of natural numbers use the following notation to then include it $\Bbb{N}_0 =\{0,1,2,3,...\}$.
- If $\Bbb{N} =\{0,1,2,3,...\}$ then 0 is included in the set of natural numbers. The authors that include 0 in the set of natural numbers then commonly use the following notation to exclude it $\Bbb{N}^+ =\{1,2,3,...\}$.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
1 &\in \Bbb{N} \\
0 &\in \Bbb{N} \\
-1 &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
\frac{1}{2} &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
\sqrt{2} &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
\pi &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
3i &\notin \Bbb{N}
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Integers

The integers are the set of positive and negative whole numbers, including zero. The set of integers is denoted by:

$$
\Bbb{Z} =\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}
$$

Multiple restrictions can be applied to the set of integers, for example:

- $\Bbb{Z}^+ =\{1,2,3,...\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}^- =\{...,-3,-2,-1\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}_0^+ =\{0,1,2,3,...\}$ 

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
1 &\in \Bbb{N} \\
0 &\in \Bbb{N} \\
-1 &\in \Bbb{N} \\
\frac{1}{2} &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
\sqrt{2} &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
\pi &\notin \Bbb{N} \\
3i &\notin \Bbb{N}
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>


### Rational and Irrational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed with a fraction of two integers. Importantly the denominator can not be zero as this is an undefined operation. Another way to remember them is that they can be written as terminating or repeating decimals. The set of rational numbers is denoted by:

$$
\Bbb{Q}=\Big\{\frac{p}{q} \mid p \in \Bbb{Z} \land p,q \in \Bbb{Z} \land q \neq 0\Big\}
$$

<Callout type="example">
The number $0.75$ is a rational number because it can be written as a fraction of two integers but also because it is a terminating decimal:

$$
0.75 = \frac{3}{4} \in \Bbb{Q}
$$

This fraction is also unique to each number, as for example the fraction $\frac{6}{8}$ can be shortened to the above
solution by dividing the denominator an nominator by the common factor 2.

$$
\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \in \Bbb{Q}
$$

Another example is $0.3333... = 0.\overline{3}$, which is a repeating decimal and can be written as the following fraction:

$$
0.3333... = 0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \in \Bbb{Q}
$$
</Callout>

On the other hand, irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. They can also not
be written as terminating or repeating decimals, as their decimal expansions go on infinitely without repeating. Irrational 
numbers are usually denoted by the symbol $\Bbb{I}$.

<Callout type="example">
For example, $\pi$, not a rational number but an irrational number:

$$
\pi = 3.14159265... \in \Bbb{I}
$$

Another example of an irrational number is $\sqrt{2}$:

$$
\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356... \in \Bbb{I}
$$

This however does not mean that all square roots are irrational numbers!

$$
\sqrt{9} = 3 \in \Bbb{N}
$$
</Callout>

<Callout type="proof" title="Proof that sqrt(2) is Irrational by Contradiction">
How do we know that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and therefore doesn't repeat or terminate and can't be expressed as a fraction of two integers?

To prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, we need to assume that it is rational and then derive a contradiction.
That is, we assume that $\sqrt{2}$ can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, and then show that this assumption is wrong and leads
to a contradiction. Suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, and can be expressed as:

$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}
$$

where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors. We can assume that $p$ and $q$ are in lowest terms, meaning that
they have been divided by their greatest common factor. After squaring both sides of this equation, we get:

$$
2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}
$$

Then multiplying both sides by $q^2$, we get:

$$
2q^2 = p^2
$$

This means that $p^2$ is even, which implies that $p$ is also even (because the square of an odd number is odd). So we
can write $p$ as $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $p = 2k$ into the equation $2q^2 = p^2$, we get:

$$
2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$
q^2 = 2k^2
$$

This means that $q^2$ is even, which implies that $q$ is also even (because the square of an odd number is odd). But
this contradicts our assumption that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors, since they both have a factor of 2. Therefore,
our initial assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false, and we conclude that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
</Callout>

### Real Numbers

Real numbers are the combination of rational and irrational numbers, i.e. all numbers from both sets. The set of real numbers is denoted by $\Bbb{R}$.

This can also be thought of as the set of all points on the number line.

\frac{1}{2} &\in \Bbb{N} \\
\sqrt{2} &\in \Bbb{N} \\
\pi &\in \Bbb{N} \\
3i &\notin \Bbb{N}
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Infinity is not a number in the traditional sense, but rather a concept that refers to something, limitless i.e. without
end. Therefore it is not an element of any set of numbers, including the real numbers.
</Callout>

#### Heron's Method

Using Heron's method we can approximate a real number by a rational number with any desired accuracy. The idea is that a square with an area of $A$ has a side length of $\sqrt A$.

To approximate $\sqrt a$ we start by creating a rectangle which we know the area of and then slowly adjust the sides to get closer to a square with the area of $A$ and therefore the side length of $\sqrt A$.

We start with a guess $a_1$ and then calculate the next guess $a_2$ by taking the average of the previous guess and the area divided by the previous guess.

$$
a_2 = \frac{a_1 + \frac{A}{a_1}}{2}
$$

This can be repeated until the desired accuracy is reached:

$$
a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n + \frac{A}{a_n}}{2}
$$

<Callout type="example">
To approximate $\sqrt{5}$ we start with a guess of $a_1=5$. We then calculate the next approximation:

$$
a_2 = \frac{5 + \frac{5}{5}}{2} = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3
$$

If we then repeat this process we get for $a_4 = 2.234$ which is a good approximation of $\sqrt{5}=2.236$.

### Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers is denoted by $\Bbb{C}$. You can see what complex numbers are and how they are used [here](/digitalGarden/maths/complexNumbers/explanation).

## Set Operations

There are several operations that can be performed on sets. These operations are similar to the operations that can be performed on numbers such as addition and subtraction.

### Union

Two sets can be joined together, this results in a so-called **union** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cup B$. The union is the set containing all elements that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.

$$
A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B\}
$$

<Image 
    src="/maths/setsUnion.png"
    caption="Venn diagram showing the union of two sets."
    width={300}
/>

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2\} \cup \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cup \{2,3\} &= \{1,2,3\} \\
\{1,2,3\} \cup \{3,4,5\} &= \{1,2,3,4,5\}
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Intersection

A new set can also be constructed by determining which elements two sets have "in common", this results in the so called **intersection** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cap B$. The intersection is the set of all things that are elements of both $A$ and $B$.

$$
A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}
$$

<Image 
    src="/maths/setsIntersection.png"
    caption="Venn diagram showing the intersection of two sets."
    width={300}
/>

To remember the difference between the union and intersection symbols, you can think of the union symbol as a "U" for "union".

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2\} \cap \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} &= \{2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

#### Disjoint Sets

If $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then we call $A$ and $B$ **disjoint** sets. This means that the sets have no elements in common.

<Callout type="example">
- $\{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} = \emptyset$ so $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$ are disjoint sets.
- $\{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} = \{2\}$ so $\{1,2\}$ and $\{2,3\}$ are not disjoint sets.
- $\{1,2\} \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$ so $\{1,2\}$ and $\emptyset$ are disjoint sets.
</Callout>

### Difference

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then the **relative complement** (or short **difference**) of $A$ and $B$, is the set of elements in $A$ without the elements of $B$. This is written as $A \setminus B$.

$$
A \setminus B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \notin B\}
$$

<Image

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2,3\} \setminus \{2,3,4\} &= \{1\} \\
\{2,3,4\} \setminus \{1,2,3\} &= \{4\} \\
\{1,2,3\} \setminus \{1,2,3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

#### Symmetric Difference

The **symmetric difference** of two sets (also known as the **disjunctive union**), is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in both sets (their intersection).
This can be written as $A \ominus B$.

$$
A \ominus B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B) = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)
$$

<Image

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2,3,4\} \ominus \{3,4,5,6\} = \{1,2,5,6\} \\
\{7,8,9,10\} \ominus \{9,10,11,12\} = \{7,8, 11,12\} \\
\{1,2,3,4\} \ominus \{1,2,3,4\} = \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Complements

The so called **absolute complement** of $A$ (or simply the **complement of** $A$) is the set of elements not in $A$. In other words, let $U$ be a set that contains all the elements under study, also called the **universal set**. 
The universal set is not always explicitly mentioned, but is rather implied or obvious such as one of the defined sets of numbers. The complement of $A$ is the difference between the universal set and $A$ and is denoted by $A^c$.

$$
A^c = U \setminus A
$$

<Image 
    src="/maths/setsAbsoluteComplement.png"
    caption="Venn diagram showing the absolute complement of the left set."

<Callout type="example">
Given the universal set $U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2,3\}^c &= \{4,5,6\} \\
\{4,5,6\}^c &= \{1,2,3\} \\
\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}^c &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Cartesian Product

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ is an element of $A$ and $b$ is an element of $B$. So in short a set of all of the possible combinations.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\{1,2\} \times \{3,4\} = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}
$$
</Callout>

## Power Set

The power set or also called super set of a set $A$ is the set containing all subsets of $A$. The empty set and $A$ itself are also elements of the power set of $A$, because these are also both subsets of $A$.

The power set of the set $A$ is commonly written as $P(A)$ or $2^{A}$

Hasse Diagram????

<Callout type="example">
Given $A={x,y,z}$:

$$
S^A=P(A)=\{\emptyset,\{x\},\{y\},\{z\},\{x,y\},\{x,z\},\{y,z\},\{x,y,z\}\}
$$
</Callout>

### Cardinality of a Power Set

The amount of elements in a power set is pretty easy to calculate. If $|A|=3$ as in the example above then $|P(A)|=2^3=8$ which can simplified to $|P(A)|=2^{|A|}$, this is why I prefer to use the $P(A)$ notation as the other notation can quickly cause confusion.

## Partitions

A partition of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $A$ such that every element $a \in A$ is in exactly one of these subsets.

The set $P$ is only a partition of $A$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:

- P does not contain the empty set, so $\emptyset \notin P$.
- The union of all the sets in $P$ is equal to $A$.
- The intersection of any two distinct sets in $P$ is the empty set, $\emptyset$

<Callout type="example">
The set $\{1,2,3\}$ has 5 possible partitions:

- $\{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$
- $\{\{1\},\{2,3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2,3\}\}$

The following are not partitions of \{1,2,3\}:

- $\{\emptyset,\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition because one of its elements is the empty set.
- $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$ is not a partition because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
- $\{\{1\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition of $\{1,2,3\}$ because none of its blocks contains the element 3.
