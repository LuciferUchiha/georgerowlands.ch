# Intervals

If we have a set of real numbers, we can define a subset of this set by specifying a range of values. This subset is called an interval.
To define an interval, we need two real numbers, $a$ and $b$, with $a < b$.

We can then define the following types of intervals:

- **Open interval**: We include all the numbers between $a$ and $b$, but not $a$ and $b$ themselves. This is denoted as $(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x < b\}$.
- **Closed interval**: We include all the numbers between $a$ and $b$, as well as $a$ and $b$ themselves. This is denoted as $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b\}$.
- **Half-open interval**: We include one of the bounds but not the other. This is denoted as $[a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x < b\}$ or $(a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x \leq b\}$.
- **Unbounded/Infinite interval**: On one or both sides, the interval extends indefinitely. This is denoted as $(-\infty, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \leq b\}$ if we want all numbers less or equal than $b$, or $(a, \infty) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x > a\}$ if we want all numbers greater than $a$.
We can also have intervals that are unbounded on both sides, such as $(-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$.

<Callout type="info">
    Note that the bound of the interval that is included is always the one with the square bracket if it is excluded it is the one with the round bracket.

    For example, $[a, b)$ includes $a$ but not $b$, while $(a, b]$ includes $b$ but not $a$.

    Also, note that the unbounded side with $\infty$ is always excluded i.e. uses the round bracket.

<Callout type="example">
    Examples of intervals:
    - $(2, 5)$ is the set of all real numbers between 2 and 5, but not including 2 and 5.
    - $[3, 7]$ is the set of all real numbers between 3 and 7, including 3 and 7.
    - $(-\infty, 4]$ is the set of all real numbers less than or equal to 4.
    - $(6, \infty)$ is the set of all real numbers greater than 6.
