# Writing Proofs

The idea of a proof is to show that a statement is definetly and unequivocally true. This is done by providing a [logical argument](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#logical-inference-and-arguments) that shows that the statement is true.

## Prooving Conditional Statements

We start with the basic building block of proofs, the [conditional statement](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#conditional-statements-if-then). The conditional statement is a statement of the form "If P then Q", $P \rightarrow Q$. 
P is often called the hypothesis and Q is called the conclusion.

So the first step in writing a proof is to write the statement that we want to prove in the form of a conditional statement. This can be done for almost 
all mathematical statements that we want to prove. 

Why do we use conditional statements? Because they are easy to prove if we know that the hypothesis is true then we can show that the conclusion is true 
thanks to truth table of the conditional statement $P \rightarrow Q$ and the [logical inference rule of modus ponens](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#logical-inference-and-arguments). So in other words we must 
show that the condition of P being true forces Q to be true.

As a reminder, the truth table of the conditional statement is:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \implies q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |

and the logical inference rule of modus ponens is:

$$
\begin{align*}
&p \implies q \\
&p \\
\hline
&q
\end{align*}
$$

<Callout type="example">
Some examples of conditional statements that we might want to prove are:

- If $n$ is an integer and $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even.
- If $n$ is an integer and $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.
</Callout>

### Direct Proof

Direct proof is the most common type of proof. It is a proof that starts with the hypothesis and then uses logical inference rules and known mathematical
facts, properties, rules and theorems to show that the conclusion is true. 

So the setup is pretty simple, we start with the hypothesis and then we 
write "Proof" to indicate that we are starting the proof. Then we write the conclusion starting with "therefore" or "thus" or "so" to indicate that we
are showing that the conclusion is true. To show that the proof is then completed after the conclusion we often write "QED" which stands for "Quod Erat
Demonstrandum" which is Latin for "that which was to be demonstrated" or we draw a square at the end of the proof $\blacksquare$. Inbeween we write the logical steps that show that the conclusion is true.

<Callout type="proof">
**If P, then Q**

Proof: Suppose P is true..
- Some logical steps...

Therefore Q is true... $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**If $n$ is an integer and $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.**

Proof: Suppose $n$ is an integer and $n$ is odd.
- Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$, by the definition of an odd integer.
- Thus $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$.
- So $n^2 = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$ and where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$.
- Thus $n^2=2m+1$ for some integer $m$.

Therefore $n^2$ is odd, by the definition of an odd integer. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

#### Proof by Cases

When proving a statement is true, we sometimes have to examine multiple cases to show that the statement is true for all possible scenarios. By 
splitting up the proof into multiple cases it can make finding the proof easier but also easier to understand. However, when using proof by cases we
must make sure that the cases are exhaustive. That is, we must show that all possible cases are covered.

<Callout type="proof">
**If P, then Q**

Proof: Suppose P is true..

Then we can consider the following cases:

**Case 1:** Suppose something. 
- Then some logical steps...

**Case 2:** Suppose something else.
- Then some logical steps...

These cases show that Q is true... $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**If $n$ is an integer then $1 + (-1)^n (2n-1)$ is a multiple of 4.**

Proof: Suppose $n$ is an integer.

Then we can consider the two cases where $n$ is even or $n$ is odd. Let's consider these two cases separately:

**Case 1:** Suppose $n$ is even.
- Then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$ and $(-1)^n = 1$.
- Thus $1 + (-1)^n (2n-1) = 1 + 1(2(2k)-1) = 1 + 1(4k-1) = 1 + 4k - 1 = 4k$, which is a multiple of 4.

**Case 2:** Suppose $n$ is odd.
- Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$ and $(-1)^n = -1$.
- Thus $1 + (-1)^n (2n-1) = 1 + (-1)(2(2k+1)-1) = 1 + (-1)(4k+2-1) = 1 + (-1)(4k+1) = 1 - 4k - 1 = -4k$, which is a multiple of 4.

These cases show that $1 + (-1)^n (2n-1)$ is always a multiple of 4. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

Sometimes two or more cases are almost the same and it can be annyoing to write them out separately. In these cases we can say that the other case is
the same as the first case and then we can combine the cases into one case. This is called "without loss of generality" or WLOG. 

<Callout type="example">
**If two integers $a$ and $b$ have opposite parity, then their sum $a+b$ is odd.**

Proof: Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers with opposite parity.

Without loss of generality, let's consider the case where $a$ is even and $b$ is odd.
- Then $a = 2k$ and $b = 2m + 1$ for some integers $k$ and $m$.
- Thus $a + b = 2k + 2m + 1 = 2(k + m) + 1$, which is odd.

Therefore, the sum of two integers with opposite parity is odd. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

### Contrapositive Proof

Contrapositive proofs work just like direct proofs by using logical inference rules and known mathematical facts, properties, rules and theorems to show that the conclusion is true. 
The only difference is that we prove the contrapositive of the original statement. So rather than proving the statement "If P then Q", we prove the statement "If not Q then not P".
We do this because in some cases it is easier to prove the contrapositive statement than the original statement. 
However, we must be careful when creating the contrapositive statement to make sure that it is equivalent to the original statement as in some 
cases you might need to use [De Morgan's Laws](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#de-morgrans-laws) to show that the contrapositive statement is equivalent to the original statement. As 
a reminder, here are De Morgan's Laws:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lnot (p \land q) &\equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q \\
\lnot (p \lor q) &\equiv \lnot p \land \lnot q
\end{align*}
$$

If we compare the truth table of the conditional statement and the contrapositive statement we can see that they are equivalent. 
Which is what allows us to use the contrapositive statement to prove the original statement.

| $p$ | $q$ | $\lnot p$ | $\lnot q$ | $p \implies q$ | $\lnot q \implies \lnot p$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |

The setup for a contrapositive proof is then slightly different from a direct proof. 

<Callout type="proof">
**If P, then Q**

Proof: Suppose P is not true..
- Some logical steps...

Therefore Q is not true... $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
Lets compare the direct proof and the contrapositive proof of the statement "If $n$ is an integer and $7n + 9$ is even, then $n$ is odd."

**Direct Proof:**

Proof: Suppose $n$ is an integer and $7n + 9$ is even.
- Then $7n + 9 = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
- Subtracting $6n + 9$ from both sides gives $n = 2k - 6n - 9$.
- Thus $n = 2k -6n - 9 = 2k -6n -10 + 1 = 2(k - 3n - 5) + 1$.
- Consequently, $n = 2m + 1$, where $m = k - 3n - 5$.

Therefore, $n$ is odd by the definition of an odd integer. $\blacksquare$

**Contrapositive Proof:**

Proof: Suppose $n$ is not odd.
- Then $n$ is even, so $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
- Then $7n + 9 = 7(2k) + 9 = 14k + 9 = 2(7k + 4) + 1$.
- Consequently, $7n + 9 = 2m + 1$, where $m = 7k + 4$.

Therefore, $7n + 9$ is odd by the definition of an odd integer and therefore not even. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

## Proof by Contradiction

Unlike direct and contrapositive proofs, proof by contradiction can be used to prove any statement, not just conditional statements.
The idea behind proof by contradiction is to assume that the statement we want to prove is false and then show that this assumption leads to 
non-sense or a [contradiction](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#tautologies-and-contradictions). This contradiction then shows that the original statement must therefore be true. So for the 
statement $P$ we assume $\lnot P$ and performing some logical steps and arrive to a contradiction of the form $C \land \lnot C$.

<Callout type="proof">
**P**

Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\lnot P$ is true.
- Some logical steps...

This leads to the contradiction $C \land \lnot C$. Therefore $P$ is true. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

So in other words we prove that $\lnot P$ being true forces a contradiction so $\lnot P \implies C \land \lnot C$. To see that 
this is the same as prooving $P$ is true let's look at the truth tables of the different statements:

| $P$ | $C$ | $\lnot P$ | $C \land \lnot C$ | $\lnot P \implies C \land \lnot C$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |

<Callout type="example">
**The square root of 2 is irrational.**

Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the square root of 2 is not irrational, so it is rational.
- Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ and let's assume that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors, so $\frac{a}{b}$ is fully reduced.
- This means that $a$ and $b$ are not both even, so at least one of them is odd. Because if both were even then they would have a common factor of 2.
- Squaring both sides gives $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $a^2 = 2b^2$.
- This means that $a^2$ is even which implies that $a$ is even. Thus as we stated before $a$ and $b$ are not both even, so $b$ is odd.
- Since $a$ is even, $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Plugging this into $a^2 = 2b^2$ gives $4k^2 = 2b^2$ or $2k^2 = b^2$.
- This means that $b^2$ is even which implies that $b$ is even. But we stated before that $b$ is odd, so we have a contradiction.

This leads to the contradiction that $b$ is both odd and even. Therefore the square root of 2 is irrational. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

### Proof by Contradiction of Conditional Statements

Using proof by contradiction we can prove simple statements as seen above but we can also use it to prove conditional statements.
To prove a conditional statement by contradiction we assume that the statement is false or in other words that $\lnot (P \implies Q)$ is true.
However, from the truth table of the conditional statement we know that $P \implies Q$ being false means that $P$ can still be true and $Q$ can be false.
So we assume that $P$ is true and $Q$ is false and then we show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

<Callout type="proof">
**If P, then Q**

Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.
- Some logical steps...

This leads to the contradiction $C \land \lnot C$. Therefore $P \implies Q$ is true. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**If $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.**

Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is not even so $n$ is odd.
- Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
- Thus $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$.
- So $n^2 = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$ and where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$.
- Consequently, $n^2 = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$, so $n^2$ is odd by the definition of an odd integer.

This leads to the contradiction that $n^2$ is both even and odd. Therefore if $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

## Prooving Biconditional Statements

Some statements can not be put into the form of a conditional statement but rather a [biconditional statement](/digitalGarden/maths/discrete/logicTheory#biconditional-statements-if-and-only-if). The biconditional statement is a statement of the form "P if and only if Q", $P \iff Q$.
However, we know that $P \iff Q$ is equivalent to $(P \implies Q) \land (Q \implies P)$, so we can prove a biconditional statement by proving the two conditional statements that make up the biconditional statement.

<Callout type="proof">
**P if and only if Q**

Proof: 

**If P, then Q**: Suppose P is true..
- Some logical steps...

**Conversely, if Q, then P**: Suppose Q is true..
- Some logical steps...

Therefore P if and only if Q. $\blacksquare$
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**An integer $n$ is odd if and only if $n^2$ is odd.**

Proof:

**If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.**: Suppose $n$ is odd.
- Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
- Thus $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$.
- So $n^2 = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$ and where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$.
- Consequently, $n^2 = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$, so $n^2$ is odd by the definition of an odd integer.

**Conversely, if $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.**: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n^2$ is odd and $n$ is not odd.
- Then $n$ is even, so $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
- Then $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$.
- So $n^2 = 2m$ for some integer $m$ and where $m = 2k^2$.
- Consequently, $n^2 = 2m$ for some integer $m$, so $n^2$ is even by the definition of an even integer.
- This leads to the contradiction that $n^2$ is both odd and even. Therefore if $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.

Therefore we've shown that an integer $n$ is odd if and only if $n^2$ is odd. $\blacksquare$
