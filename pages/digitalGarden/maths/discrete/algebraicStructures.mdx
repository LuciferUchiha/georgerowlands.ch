## Operations

### Commutativity

An operation $*$ is commutative if for all $a, b \in S$:

$$
a * b = b * a
$$

In other words, the order of the operands does not matter.

<Callout type="example">
Addition and multiplication are commutative operations. For example:

$$
\begin{align*}
2 + 3 &= 3 + 2 = 5 \\
2 \cdot 3 &= 3 \cdot 2 = 6
\end{align*}
$$

Subtraction and division are not commutative operations. For example:

$$
\begin{align*}
2 - 3 &\neq 3 - 2 \\
2 \div 3 &\neq 3 \div 2
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Associativity

An operation $*$ is associative if for all $a, b, c \in S$:

$$
a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c
$$

In other words, the grouping of the operands does not matter. So you can group the operands in any way you like
as long as the order of the operands is preserved and there are no other operations in between.

<Callout type="example">
Addition and multiplication are associative operations. For example:

$$
\begin{align*}
2 + (3 + 4) &= (2 + 3) + 4 = 9 \\
2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) &= (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 = 24
\end{align*}
$$

### Distributivity

An operation $*$ is distributive with respect to another operation $+$ if for all $a, b, c \in S$:

$$
a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c) 
$$

and

$$
(b + c) * a = (b * a) + (c * a)
$$

In other words, the operation "distributes" itself over the other operation. You can think of 
distributing as copying the operation to each of the operands of the other operation.

<Callout type="example">
The operation of multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. For example:

$$
2 \cdot (3 + 4) = (2 \cdot 3) + (2 \cdot 4) = 14
$$
</Callout>

#### Left Distributivity

An operation $*$ is left distributive if for all $a, b, c \in S$ the operation is distributive with respect to $+$ 
when the operation is on the left:

$$
a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
$$

not necessarily:

$$
(b + c) * a = (b * a) + (c * a)
$$
