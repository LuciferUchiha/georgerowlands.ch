# Equivalence Relations

A relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if it is reflex, symmetric and transitive. To show that the relation 
$R$ is an equivalence relation, we can write instead of $aRb$, $a \equiv b$ or $a \sim b$ if the relation is clear and 
$a$ is related to $b$. If the relation is not clear, we can write $a \equiv_R b$ or $a \sim_R b$.

Therefore we know that a relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if it satisfies the following properties:

- $\forall a \in A, a \equiv_R a$ (reflexive)
- $\forall a, b \in A, a \equiv_R b \implies b \equiv_R a$ (symmetric)
- $\forall a, b, c \in A, a \equiv_R b \land b \equiv_R c \implies a \equiv_R c$ (transitive)

This makes sense if we think of we compare it to our normal understandin of "equivalence":
- We say that two things that are the same are equivalent to each other (reflexive).
- If something is equivalent to something else, then that something else is equivalent to the first thing (symmetric).
- If something is equivalent to something else, and that something else is equivalent to another thing, then the first thing is equivalent to the other thing (transitive).

<Callout type="example">
For the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, the relation $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2,3), (3, 2)\}$ is an equivalence relation.

- The relation $R$ is reflexive because $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) \in R$.
- The relation $R$ is symmetric because $(2, 3), (3, 2) \in R$. $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ do not have to be in $R$.
- The relation $R$ is transitive because $(2, 3), (3, 2) \in R$ and $(2, 2), (3, 3) \in R$.

## Equivalence Classes

also how they relate to partitions

$$
\[a\]_R = \{x \in A | x \equiv_R a\}
