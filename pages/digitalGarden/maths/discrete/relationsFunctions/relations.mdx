# Relations

In mathematics we use many symbols such as $\leq$, $\geq$, $<$, $>$, $=$, $\neq$ to represent the relationship between two objects. These symbols are called relations or relational operators because they convey the relationship between two objects.
These realtions are defined on a specific set. For example, the relation $\leq$ is defined on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. To define a relation, we need to specify a set of order pairs that relates a set $A$'s elements to each other i.e. is a subset of $A \times A$:
These order pairs are special as $(a, b)$ is used to define the relationship between $a$ and $b$, so we can say that "$a$ relates to $b$". 

$$
R \subseteq \{(a, b) \in A \times A\}
$$

Lets now put this all together and define a relation on the set $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$:

$$
R = \{(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)\} \subseteq A \times A
$$

If we then take an element of the realtion such as $(1, 1)$ it means that $1$ relates to $1$ and $(1, 3)$ means that $1$ relates to $3$. The relation shown above can be thought of as "has the same parity" as $1$ and $3$ are both odd and $2$ and $4$ are both even.
This relationship can also be denoted as followed:

$$
(a, b) \in R \iff aRb
$$

This means that if the order pair $(a, b)$ is in the relation $R$, then $a$ relates to $b$, so $aRb$. If they are not in the relation, then $a$ does not relate to $b$ and we can denote this as $a \cancel{R} b$.

There are many ways to show relations such as a table or a directed graph, sometimes also called a digraph, arrow diagram or mapping diagram. The table below shows the relation $R$ defined above:

| $R$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|0|1|0|
|2|0|1|0|1|
|3|1|0|1|0|
|4|0|1|0|1|

## Properties of Relations

Depending on the relationship between the elements of a set, a relation can have different properties.

### Reflexive 

A relation $R$ is reflexive if every element in the set $A$ relates to itself. 

$$
\forall a \in A, (a, a) \in R
$$

An example of a reflexive relation is the relation $\leq$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as every number is less than or equal to itself.

We can see in the table below that every element has a "1" in the diagonal and therefore the relation is reflexive.
The same can be seen in the diagram where every element has a loop to itself.

### Irreflexive

A relation $R$ is irreflexive if no element in the set $A$ relates to itself.

$$
\forall a \in A, (a, a) \notin R
$$

An example of an irreflexive relation is the relation $<$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as no number is less than itself.

We can see in the table below that every element has a "0" in the diagonal and therefore the relation is irreflexive.
The same can be seen in the diagram where no element has a loop to itself.

### Symmetric

A relation $R$ is symmetric if for every element $(a, b)$ in the relation, $(b, a)$ is also in the relation.

$$
\forall a, b \in A, (a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \in R
$$

An example of a symmetric relation is the relation $=$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as if $a = b$ then $b = a$.

We can see in the table below that if $(a, b)$ is in the relation then $(b, a)$ is also in the relation and therefore the relation is symmetric.
This means that the table is symmetrical or mirrored along the diagonal. 
The same can be seen in the diagram where if there is an arrow from $a$ to $b$ then there is an arrow from $b$ to $a$.

### Antisymmetric

A relation $R$ is antisymmetric if for every element $(a, b)$ in the relation, $(b, a)$ is not in the relation unless $a = b$.

$$
\forall a, b \in A, \big[(a, b) \in R \land (b, a) \in R\big] \implies a = b
$$

An example of an antisymmetric relation is the relation $\geq$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as if $a \geq b$ and $b \geq a$ then $a = b$.

We can see in the table below that if $(a, b)$ is in the relation and $(b, a)$ is also in the relation then the corresponding diagonal element is a "1" and therefore the relation is antisymmetric.
The same can be seen in the diagram that there are no arrows from $a$ to $b$ and $b$ to $a$ only one way arrows and loops.

### Asymmetric

A relation $R$ is asymmetric if for every element $(a, b)$ in the relation, $(b, a)$ is not in the relation, even if $a = b$. So it can be thought of as a stricter version of antisymmetric or a combination of antisymmetric and irreflexive.

$$
\forall a, b \in A, \(a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \notin R
$$

An example of an asymmetric relation is the relation $<$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as if $a < b$ then $b \nless a$.

We can see in the table below that if $(a, b)$ is in the relation then $(b, a)$ is not in the relation and all the diagonal elements are "0" and therefore the relation is asymmetric.
The same can be seen in the diagram that there are no arrows from $a$ to $b$ and $b$ to $a$ and no loops.

### Transitive

A relation $R$ is transitive if for every element $(a, b)$ and $(b, c)$ in the relation, $(a, c)$ is also in the relation.

$$
\forall a, b, c \in A, \big[(a, b) \in R \land (b, c) \in R\big] \implies (a, c) \in R
$$

An example of a transitive relation is the relation $\leq$ on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$.

We can see in the table below that if $(a, b)$ and $(b, c)$ are in the relation then $(a, c)$ is also in the relation and therefore the relation is transitive.
The same can be seen in the diagram that if there is an arrow from $a$ to $b$ and $b$ to $c$ then there is an arrow from $a$ to $c$.

    Importantly note if for example $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$ then $(a,a)$ and $(b,b)$ must also be in the relation for it to be transitive.
