# Logic Theory

Logic theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with formal systems of logic. Logic theory is also commonly reffered to as boolean algebra 
as it primarly deals with the boolean values of true and false.

## Propositions

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. For example, the statement "Zürich is in Switzerland" is a proposition because it is either true or false, but not both. 
A true/truthy value is represented by the symbol $T$ or $1$ and a false/falsy value is represented by the symbol $F$ or $0$.

<Callout type="example">
- "There are more wheels then doors in the world" is a proposition because it is either true or false. However, I don't know the answer to this question.
- "My name is George" is a proposition (True).
- "The sky is green" is a proposition (False).
- "What time is it?" is not a proposition because it is a question.
- "This proposition is false" is not a proposition because it is a paradox. If it is a proposition then it must be false which would make it true, but if it is true then it must be false.
</Callout>

### Compound Propositions

Propositions can be combined to form compound propositions. 

<Callout type="example">
If we have the proposition $p$ = "Zürich is in Switzerland" (True) and the proposition $q$ = "Zürich is the capital of Switzerland" (False, it is Bern), we can combine them to form the compound proposition:

"Zürich is in Switzerland and Zürich is the capital of Switzerland" which is false.

### Logical Operators

Rather then using words to express propositions and combinations we can use symbols and operators. Each logical operator has a truth table that defines the output of the operator based on the input propositions.

These operators are not just used in logic theory but also in programming languages and circuits in the form of logical gates.

#### Conjunction (AND)

The conjunction operator is represented by the symbol $\land$ and is true only if both the input propositions $p$ **and** $q$ are true. Hence the name "AND". To remember the symbol $\land$ think of it as a capital letter "A" for "AND".

The truth table for the conjunction operator is as follows for the input propositions $p$ and $q$:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |

#### Disjunction (OR)

The disjunction operator is represented by the symbol $\lor$ and is true if at least one of the input propositions $p$ **or** $q$ is true. Hence the name "OR". 

The truth table for the disjunction operator is as follows for the input propositions $p$ and $q$:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |

#### Negation (NOT)

The negation operator is a unary operator, meaning it only takes one input proposition $p$ rather then two, like the previous operators. The negation operator is represented by the symbol $\lnot$ and is true if the input proposition $p$ is false and false if the input proposition $p$ is true. 
Hence the name "NOT", as it negates, inverts or flips the input proposition. Sometimes the negation operator is represented by an exclamation mark $!$, as this is often the symbol used in programming languages.

The truth table for the negation operator is as follows for the input proposition $p$:

| $p$ | $\lnot p$ |
| :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $0$ |
