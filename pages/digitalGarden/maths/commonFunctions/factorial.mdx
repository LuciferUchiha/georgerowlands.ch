# Factorial

The factorial is a function that is defined only for non-negative integers $n$. The factorial of a number is written as
$n!$, and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. Important to note is that $0! = 1$ and $1! = 1$. 
For $n > 1$, the factorial is defined as:

$$
n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)\cdot ... \cdot 2 \cdot 1
$$

or alternatively,

$$
n! = \prod_{x=1}^{n}{x}
$$

<Callout type="example">
| $n$ | $n!$ |
| --- | --- |
| $0$ | $1$ |
| $1$ | $1$ |
| $2$ | $2 \cdot 1 = 2$ |
| $3$ | $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ |
| $4$ | $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$ |
| $5$ | $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$ |
| $n$ | $n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)\cdot ... \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ |

<Callout type="proof" title="Why is $0! = 1$?">
There are many reasons why $0!$ must be $1$, most of them being related to combinatorics and counting problems. However, there is 
an intuitive explanation that can be given. Notice above that $n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$. This means that the factorial of a number
is the product of that number and the factorial of the number that is one less than it. 

For the above to hold true for $1!$ we need to have $0! = 1$ because if $0!=0$, then $1!$ would be:

$$
1! = 1 \cdot (1-1)! = 1 \cdot 0! = 1 \cdot 0 = 0
$$

and all other factorials would also be $0$ as well. Therefore, $0!$ must be $1$.

## Sterlings Approximation

$$
n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n
