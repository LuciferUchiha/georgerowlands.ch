# Vectors

## What is a Vector?

We have already seen that vectors are just special types of matrices with either one row or one column, primarly with one column.
However, depending on the field you are working in, a vector can mean many different things. In computer science, a vector is just a list of numbers, i.e. a 1D array or n-tuple.
The elements of a vector are more commonly called components rather than elements.

In maths, a vector can be thought of as an arrow in space that have a starting and ending point, also reffered to as the tail and the head of the vector. Most commonly 
vectors are denoted by a lowercase letter either in bold or with an arrow above it, e.g. $\vec{v}$ or $\boldsymbol{v}$. If the vector is defined by two points, $A$ and $B$, 
then the vector is denoted as $\vec{AB}$, this type of vector is a position vector. Usually the starting point of the vector is at the origin,
$(0, 0)$ in 2D space or $(0, 0, 0)$ in 3D space etc. making the head of the vector the point $(x, y)$ or $(x, y, z)$ etc.

Vectors are easily visualized in 2D and 3D space, but can be extended to any number of dimensions. 
If we define that all vectors have the same starting point, they can be uniquely be defined by their ending point 
which is the same as the direction and length of the vector. The length of the vector is also called the magnitude.

This is also in line with vectors in physics, where vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction 
such as velocity, force, acceleration, etc. For example, a force vector indicates both the magnitude of the force and 
the direction in which it is applied. Unlike position vectors, these vectors do not necessarily have a fixed starting point at the origin. 
Instead, they can be applied at any point in space, and their effects are determined by their magnitude and direction. 
The length of the vector represents the magnitude of the physical quantity, and the direction of the arrow indicates the direction in which the quantity acts.

## Basic Operations on Vectors and Matrices

All the vector operations can be thought of as matrix operations, because a vector can be thought of as a matrix with one column.

### Vector Addition

To add two vectors together, we simply add the corresponding components of the vectors together i.e. we just add element-wise. This also means that the two vectors 
must have the same number of components/dimensions. This is equivalent to matrix addition.
So we can add two vectors $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as follows:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_n
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 \\
    y_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    y_n
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 + y_1 \\
    x_2 + y_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_n + y_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    5 \\
    6
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 + 4 \\
    2 + 5 \\
    3 + 6
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    5 \\
    7 \\
    9
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</Callout>

We can also visualize vector addition nicely in 2D and 3D space with position vectors. We can think of vector addition as moving the tail of the second vector to the head of the first vector. The 
resulting vector is the vector that starts at the tail of the first vector and ends at the head of the second vector.

### Scalar Multiplication

We can multiply a vector by a scalar, i.e. a number, by multiplying each component of the vector by the scalar. So if we have a vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ and a scalar $s$, 
then we can multiply them together as follows:

$$
s\boldsymbol{x} = s \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_n
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    sx_1 \\
    sx_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    sx_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<Callout type="example">
$$
2\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    2 \cdot 1 \\
    2 \cdot 2 \\
    2 \cdot 3
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    2 \\
    4 \\
    6
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</Callout>

We can also visualize scalar multiplication nicely in 2D and 3D space. We can think of scalar multiplication as stretching or shrinking the vector by the scalar. This is 
why scalar multiplication is also called vector scaling and the number is called the scalar. If the scalar is negative, then the vector will be flipped around, i.e. it will
point in the opposite direction.

### Subtraction

Subtracting two vectors is the same as adding the first vector to the negative of the second vector, i.e. multiplying the second vector by $-1$. So if we have two vectors
we can subtract them as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{x} + (-\boldsymbol{y})
$$

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    5 \\
    6
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
    -4 \\
    -5 \\
    -6
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 + (-4) \\
    2 + (-5) \\
    3 + (-6)
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -3 \\
    -3 \\
    -3
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</Callout>

When visualizing the subtraction of two vectors, we can think of it as adding the negative of the second vector to the first
vector, i.e. moving the tail of the second vector after flipping it to the head of the first vector.

### Matrix-Vector Multiplication


#### Linear Combinations

as a matrix times a vector can relate this back to a coefficient matrix and a solution vector.


### Dot Product

The dot product or also called the inner product is the most common type of vector multiplication. This is defined 
just like the matrix multiplication. However, so the dimensions of the two vectors must be the same. To achieve this,
the second vector is transposed. The dot product is often denoted as$\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y}$, but sometimes
also as $\langle \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y} \rangle$ rather than $\boldsymbol{x}^T \cdot \boldsymbol{y}$ to
avoid confusion with the matrix multiplication or scalar multiplication.
So if we have two vectors $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ and 
$\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$, then we can multiply them together as follows:

$$
\langle \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y} \rangle = \boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} =
\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 \\
    y_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    y_n
\end{bmatrix} = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \dots + x_ny_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i
$$

From the dimensions we can also clearly see that the dot product results in a scalar which is 
why it is also called the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication!

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    5 \\
    6
\end{bmatrix} = 1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32
$$
</Callout>

Unlike the matrix multiplication, the dot product is commutative, meaning that the order in which we multiply the vectors together does not matter.

<Callout type="info" title="Why is the dot product commutative?">
The dot product is also commutative for real numbers, meaning that the order in which we multiply the vectors together does not matter as long
as the first vector is transposed. This is because the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the two vectors 
and the pairs of components are the same in both cases. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 \\
    y_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    y_n
\end{bmatrix} = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \dots + x_ny_n\\
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 & y_2 & \dots & y_n
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_n
\end{bmatrix} = y_1x_1 + y_2x_2 + \dots + y_nx_n
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Norms

A norm is a function denoted by $\|\cdot\|$ that maps vectors to real values and satisfies the following properties:

- It is positiv definit meaning it assigns a non-negative real numbers, i.e a length or size to each vector. 
- If the norm of a vector is zero, then the vector is the zero vector.
- The norm of a vector scaled by a scalar is equal to the absolute value of the scalar times the norm of the vector, 
i.e. $\|s\boldsymbol{x}\| = |s|\|\boldsymbol{x}\|$ where $s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
- The triangle inequality holds which we will see later.

In simple terms the norm of a vector is the length of the vector. There are many different types of norms, but the most common ones are the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms, 
also known as the Manhattan and Euclidean norms respectively. The $L_p$ norm is a generalization of the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms. We denote a vector's norm by writting it in between 
two vertical bars, e.g. $\|\boldsymbol{x}\|$, and the subscript denotes the type of norm, e.g. $\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_1$ or $\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2$ etc. If 
the subscript is omitted, then the $L_2$ norm is assumed.

#### Manhattan Norm

The Manhattan norm or $L_1$ norm is defined as the sum of the [absolute values]() of the vector's components. 

It is called the Manhattan norm because it can be thought of as the distance 
between two points along the axis of a rectangular grid, like the streets of Manhattan or any other city with a grid-like structure.
No matter how we move along the roads of Manhattan, the distance between two points is always the same.

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_1 = |x_1| + |x_2| + \dots + |x_n| = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|
$$

<Callout type="example">
If $\boldsymbol{x}$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then the $L_1$ norm of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is:

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_1 = |1| + |2| + |3| = 6
$$
</Callout>

#### Euclidean Norm

As the name suggests, the Euclidean norm or $L_2$ norm is the distance between two points in Euclidean space, i.e. the straight line distance between two points. 
For the 2D case, the Euclidean norm is just the Pythagorean theorem, i.e the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}
$$

From the defintion above we can actually see that the Euclidean norm is the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself.

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}} = \sqrt{\langle \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle}
$$

    width={400}
    />

##### Schwarz Inequality

The Schwarz inequality states that the dot product of two vectors is always less than or equal to the product of the two vectors' norms.

$$
|\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y}| \leq \|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2 \|\boldsymbol{y}\|_2
$$

This inequality is also called the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

<Callout type="proof">
Equality holds if and only if one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other vector, i.e. the vectors are linearly dependent.
</Callout>

##### Triangle Inequality

For a norm to be a norm, one of the properties it must satisfy is the triangle inequality. 
The triangle inequality states that the norm of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of 
the norms of the two vectors.

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x} \pm \boldsymbol{y}\|_2 \leq \|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2 \pm \|\boldsymbol{y}\|_2
$$

<Callout type="proof">
Can be derived from the Schwarz inequality.
</Callout>

#### P-Norm

The idea of the $L_p$ norm is to generalize the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms. The $L_p$ norm is defined as:

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_p = \left(|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dots + |x_n|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

An arbitrary norm is rarely used in practice, most commonly the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms are used. For some use-cases the $L_\infty$ norm is used, which is defined as:

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_\infty = \max_i |x_i|
$$

In other words, the $L_\infty$ norm is vector component with the largest absolute value.

<Callout type="example">
If $\boldsymbol{x}$ is defined as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then the $L_4$ norm of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is:

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_4 = \left(|1|^4 + |2|^4 + |3|^4\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = \left(1 + 16 + 81\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 4
$$

and the $L_\infty$ norm of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is:

$$
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_\infty = \max_i |x_i| = \max\{1, 2, 3\} = 3
$$
</Callout>

#### Meaning of the Dot Product

The question now is what is the dot product actually? 


We can also visualize the dot product nicely in 2D and 3D space. The dot product of two vectors is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors multiplied by the length of 
the two vectors if we place the tails at the same point. So if we have two vectors $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$, then we can calculate the dot product as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = \|\boldsymbol{x}\| \|\boldsymbol{y}\| \cos(\theta)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors. We can also calculate the angle between the two vectors by rewriting the equation above as follows:

$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y}}{\|\boldsymbol{x}\| \|\boldsymbol{y}\|}\right)
$$

Where $\cos^{-1}$ is the inverse cosine function, also called the arccosine function.

<Image

<Callout type="example">
If $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ are defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
    3 \\
    -2
\end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    7
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then the angle between $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y}}{\|\boldsymbol{x}\| \|\boldsymbol{y}\|}\right) \\
&= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3 \cdot 1 + (-2) \cdot 7}{\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} \sqrt{1^2 + 7^2}}\right) \\
&= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3 - 14}{\sqrt{9 + 4} \sqrt{1 + 49}}\right) \\
&= \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-11}{\sqrt{13} \sqrt{50}}\right) \\
&= 115.6^\circ
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

#### Orthogonal Vectors

We call two vectors orthogonal if the angle between them is 90 degrees, i.e. they are perpendicular to each other. If two vectors are orthogonal, then their dot product is 
zero, because $\cos(90) = 0$. So if we have two vectors $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$, then we can check if they are orthogonal as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{y} = 0
$$

### Inner Product

### Vector Projection

### Cross Product

### Normalization

Normalizing means to bring something into some sort of normal or standard state. In the case of vectors, normalizing means to scale the vector in a way that it's length is 
equal to one. Often we denote a normalized vector by adding a hat to the vector, e.g. $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$ is the normalized vector of $\boldsymbol{x}$. So we can 
say if $\|\boldsymbol{x}\| = 1$, then $\boldsymbol{x}$ is normalized. From this definition we can see that to normalize a vector, we simply divide the vector by it's length, 
i.e. we divide the vector by a scalar. So if we have a vector $\boldsymbol{x}$, then we can normalize it as follows:

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{x}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_2}
$$

This normalized vector will have the same direction as the original vector, but it's length will be equal to one. By eliminating the length of the vector, we can uniquely 
identify a vector by it's direction. This is useful because we can now compare vectors based on their direction, without having to worry about their length. All these 
normalized vectors are also called unit vectors and if they are placed at the origin in 2D they span the unit circle.

    />

#### Orthonormal Vector

We can now combine the idea of orthogonal vectors and normalized vectors to get orthonormal vectors. Orthonormal vectors are vectors that are orthogonal to each other and 
have a length of one.

## Linear Independence

Two vectors are linearly independent if neither of them can be written as a linear combination of the other. In other words, two vectors are linearly independent if 
they are not scalar multiples of each other. It is however easier to find to define and check for linear dependence. The vectors $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ 
are linearly dependent if:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = c\boldsymbol{b} \quad \text{for some } c \in \mathbb{R}
$$

this can also be written as:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} - c\boldsymbol{b} = \boldsymbol{0}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{0}$ is the zero vector. This means that the vectors $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly dependent 
if they are collinear, i.e. they lie on the same line. The two equations above can also be used to define linear independence, we just replace the equal sign with a 
not equal sign.

    caption="The left two vectors are linearly independent, while the right two vectors are linearly dependent."

<Callout type="example">
If $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    2 \\
    4 \\
    6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly dependent because:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = 2\boldsymbol{b}
$$

However, if $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3
\end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    2 \\
    3 \\
    4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ are linearly independent because no scalar multiple of $\boldsymbol{b}$ can be equal to $\boldsymbol{a}$.
