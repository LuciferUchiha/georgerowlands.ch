# Linear Equations

An equation is linear if it has the following form:

$$
a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_ix_i = 0
$$

So it can have multiple variables, but the variables are only raised to the power of 1 or 0. The following is not a linear equation:

$$
x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
$$

The above equation is in the so called 
general form, where $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are the coefficients of the variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ respectively and $b$ is the constant term. 
Importantly to the right of the equal sign is 0. In the standard form, the constant term is move to the right side of the equation.

$$
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b
$$
