# Orthogonality

two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero

two subspaces are orthogonal if every vector in the first subspace is orthogonal to every vector in the second subspace

To check if two spaces are orthogonal we just need to check if the basis vectors of one space are orthogonal to the basis vectors of the other space

If two spaces are orthogonal then the set of basis is linearly independent. so no intersection between the two spaces and union of the two spaces makes a larger space.

If two spaces are orthogonal then the dimension of the intersection of the two spaces is zero

We can find the orthogonal complement of a space

The null space of a matrix is the orthogonal complement of the row space of the matrix or the column space of the transpose of the matrix
Together the entire space can be spanned

the compliment of the compliment is the original space

## Projections

A^TA is invertable and symmetric because have same nullspace as A

projection matrix

## Least Squares

## Gram-Schmidt

orthornormal basis

make projections easier

## QR Decomposition

## Psuedo Inverses

## Farkas Lemma

Don't think this is worth my time
