# Vector Spaces

a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called vectors, can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called scalars.
More generally scalars can be elements of a field, but in this case we will only consider real numbers i.e 
a real vector space rather then if we were to consider complex numbers a complex vector space.

takes binary operation for vector addition and a binary function for scalar multiplication.

Must fullfill the following properties:


An equivalent definition of a vector space can be given, which is much more concise but less elementary: 
the first four axioms (related to vector addition) say that a vector space is an abelian group under 
addition, and the four remaining axioms (related to the scalar multiplication) say that this operation defines a 
ring homomorphism from the field F into the endomorphism ring of this group.

Subtraction of two vectors can be defined as the addition of the first vector with the additive inverse of the second vector.

Even more concisely, a vector space is a module over a field.
