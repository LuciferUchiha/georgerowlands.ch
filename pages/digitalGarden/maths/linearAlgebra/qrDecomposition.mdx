# QR Decomposition

## Gram-Schmidt Process

We have seen that having an **orthonormal basis** is extremely useful in linear algebra, particularly when calculating the projection of a vector 
onto a subspace spanned by a set of vectors. With an orthonormal basis, operations such as projections become simpler and more computationally 
efficient. However, in general, the basis vectors of a subspace are not orthonormal. This is where the **Gram-Schmidt process** comes into play.

The Gram-Schmidt process is a systematic method for converting a set of linearly independent vectors into a set of orthonormal vectors. These 
orthonormal vectors span the same subspace as the original vectors but have the added advantage of being orthogonal (pairwise perpendicular) 
and normalized (unit length).

So the idea is given a set of linearly independent vectors $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, the goal of the Gram-Schmidt process is to construct a 
set of orthonormal vectors $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ such that:
1. The span of $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ is the same as the span of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.
2. Each vector $q_i$ is orthogonal to all the previous vectors $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{i-1}$.
3. Each $q_i$ has unit norm, i.e., $\|q_i\| = 1$.

To better understand the process, we will first demonstrate it for two vectors and then generalize it to $n$ vectors.
For the first vector, we simply normalize it to obtain $q_1$, the first orthonormal vector:

$$
q_1 = \frac{a_1}{\|a_1\|}
$$

For the second vector $a_2$, we want to make it orthogonal to $q_1$. From the image below, we can see that to make $a_2$ orthogonal 
to $q_1$, we can subtract the projection of $a_2$ onto $q_1$ from $a_2$. If you recall the projection formula, the vector we 
get after subtracting the projection is often referred to as the **error vector**.

So we subtract from $a_2$ a multiple of $q_1$ such that the resulting vector is orthogonal to $q_1$. This is then followed by 
normalizing the resulting vector to get $q_2$. To do this, we use the formula for projecting a vector onto a subspace. In general, 
the formula for projecting a vector $\boldsymbol{b}$ onto a subspace $S$ spanned by the columns of a matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is defined as:

$$
\text{proj}_S(\boldsymbol{b}) = \boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{A})^{-1}\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{b}
$$

In the specific case of projecting a vector $\boldsymbol{b}$ onto another vector $\boldsymbol{a}$, this simplifies to:

$$
\text{proj}_S(\boldsymbol{b}) = \frac{\boldsymbol{aa}^T}{\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{a}}\boldsymbol{b}
$$

Using this, we now calculate the projection of $a_2$ onto $q_1$:

$$
\text{proj}_{q_1}(a_2) = \frac{q_1^T a_2}{q_1^T q_1} q_1
$$

The orthogonal component of $a_2$, denoted as $\hat{q}_2$, is obtained by subtracting this projection from $a_2$:

$$
\hat{q}_2 = a_2 - \text{proj}_{q_1}(a_2) = a_2 - \frac{q_1^T a_2}{q_1^T q_1} q_1
$$

Finally, we normalize $\hat{q}_2$ to obtain $q_2$, the second orthonormal vector:

$$
q_2 = \frac{\hat{q}_2}{\|\hat{q}_2\|} = \frac{a_2 - \frac{q_1^T a_2}{q_1^T q_1} q_1}{\left\| a_2 - \frac{q_1^T a_2}{q_1^T q_1} q_1 \right\|}
$$

We notice that if $a_2$ is already orthogonal to $q_1$ then the projection becomes the zero vector, and $q_2$ is simply 
the normalized version of $a_2$:

$$
q_2 = \frac{a_2}{\|a_2\|}
$$

We can check that $q_1$ and $q_2$ are orthogonal by calculating their dot product:

$$
\begin{align*}
q_1^Tq_2 &= q_1^T\left(\frac{a_2 - (a_2^Tq_1)q_1}{\|a_2 - (a_2^Tq_1)q_1\|}\right) \\
&= \frac{q_1^Ta_2 - (q_1^Ta_2)q_1^Tq_1}{\|a_2 - (a_2^Tq_1)q_1\|} \\
&= \frac{q_1^Ta_2 - q_1^Ta_2}{\|a_2 - (a_2^Tq_1)q_1\|} \\
&= \frac{0}{\|a_2 - (a_2^Tq_1)q_1\|} = 0
\end{align*}
$$

### General Case

The process can be extended to $n$ vectors. For each vector $a_k$ ($k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$), we subtract the projections 
of $a_k$ onto all the previously computed orthonormal vectors $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{k-1}$. The resulting vector is then normalized.
So we can summarize the Gram-Schmidt process as follows:
1. Start with $q_1 = \frac{a_1}{\|a_1\|}$.
2. For $k = 2, 3, \ldots, n$:
   - Subtract the projections of $a_k$ onto all previous $q_i$ vectors:
     $$
     \hat{q}_k = a_k - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \text{proj}_{q_i}(a_k) = a_k - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \frac{q_i^T a_k}{q_i^T q_i} q_i
     $$
   - Normalize the resulting vector:
     $$
     q_k = \frac{\hat{q}_k}{\|\hat{q}_k\|}
     $$

The intuition behind the Gram-Schmidt process is that we initially have a vector that has some components in the directions of the other vectors. 
So we could think of the vector $a_n$ as a sum of the orthogonal direction $q_n$ and the direction of the other vectors:

$$
a_n = \lambda q_n + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \mu_i q_i
$$

So by subtracting the projection of the vector onto the previously computed orthonormal vectors, we are systematically removing components of 
the vector that lie in the directions of those vectors. This ensures that the resulting vector is orthogonal and linearly independent
to all the previous ones. Normalization then ensures that the vector has unit length, completing the orthonormalization process.

The correctness of the Gram-Schmidt process can be proven via mathematical induction. However, this proof is omitted here for brevity.

## QR Decomposition

The Gram-Schmidt process not only provides a systematic way to construct orthonormal bases, but it also gives rise to a powerful matrix 
factorization called the **QR decomposition**. Given a matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ with linearly independent columns, the QR decomposition 
is defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{Q} \boldsymbol{R}
$$

Where $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is an orthonormal matrix, meaning its columns are orthonormal vectors (i.e., $\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{Q} = \boldsymbol{I}$) and 
$\boldsymbol{R}$ is an upper triangular matrix, meaning all entries below the diagonal are zero. We define the matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$ as: 

$$
\boldsymbol{R} = \boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{A}
$$

As when we left multiply the decomposition by $\boldsymbol{Q}^T$, we get $\boldsymbol{R} = \boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{A}$ because 
$\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{Q} = \boldsymbol{I}$.

The QR decomposition naturally comes from the Gram-Schmidt process as we start with the columns of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and construct an orthonormal 
set of vectors which result in the columns of $\boldsymbol{Q}$. 
What this decomposition is then telling us is that we can reconstruct each column of $\boldsymbol{A}$ as a linear combination of the columns of $\boldsymbol{Q}$, 
where the coefficients of this linear combination are given by the entries of $\boldsymbol{R}$.

To see this explicitly, let $\boldsymbol{A}$ be a matrix with columns $\boldsymbol{a}_1, \boldsymbol{a}_2, \ldots, \boldsymbol{a}_n$. Using 
Gram-Schmidt, we construct the orthonormal vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_1, \boldsymbol{q}_2, \ldots, \boldsymbol{q}_n$ such that:

$$
\boldsymbol{a}_k = \sum_{i=1}^k r_{ik} \boldsymbol{q}_i
$$

Here, $r_{ik}$ are the coefficients that describe how each column of $\boldsymbol{A}$ is expressed as a linear combination of the orthonormal 
vectors. These coefficients form the entries of the upper triangular matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$. 

You might be wondering how we already know that $\boldsymbol{R}$ is upper triangular. To understand why $\boldsymbol{R}$ is upper triangular, 
consider the structure of the Gram-Schmidt process. Each vector $\boldsymbol{q}_k$ is constructed to be orthogonal to the previous vectors 
$\boldsymbol{q}_1, \boldsymbol{q}_2, \ldots, \boldsymbol{q}_{k-1}$. This means that for $i < k$, the projection of $\boldsymbol{a}_k$ onto 
$\boldsymbol{q}_i$ is zero. Consequently, the entries $r_{ik}$ for $i > k$ are also zero. This pattern implies that $\boldsymbol{R}$ is upper 
triangular, as all entries below the diagonal vanish. Let's look at the case where $\boldsymbol{A}$ has three columns:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{a}_1 & \boldsymbol{a}_2 & \boldsymbol{a}_3 \end{bmatrix}
, \quad \boldsymbol{Q} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{q}_1 & \boldsymbol{q}_2 & \boldsymbol{q}_3 \end{bmatrix},
 \quad \boldsymbol{R} = \begin{bmatrix} r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\ 0 & r_{22} & r_{23} \\ 0 & 0 & r_{33} \end{bmatrix}.
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{a}_1 & \boldsymbol{a}_2 & \boldsymbol{a}_3 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{q}_1 & \boldsymbol{q}_2 & \boldsymbol{q}_3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\ 0 & r_{22} & r_{23} \\ 0 & 0 & r_{33} \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Lastly let's look at some of the subspaces of the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ and compare them to the decomposition.
First let's compare the column space of $\boldsymbol{A}$ to the column space of $\boldsymbol{Q}$.
The column space of $\boldsymbol{Q}$, denoted $\boldsymbol{C(Q)}$, is the same as the column space of $\boldsymbol{A}$, denoted 
$\boldsymbol{C(A)}$. This arises naturally from the Gram-Schmidt process, as $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is constructed by orthonormalizing the 
columns of $\boldsymbol{A}$. In other words, the orthonormal vectors in $\boldsymbol{Q}$ span the same subspace as the original 
(linearly independent) columns of $\boldsymbol{A}$.

This property is crucial because it means that $\boldsymbol{Q}$ retains all the information about the subspace spanned by $\boldsymbol{A}$, 
making $\boldsymbol{Q}$ an ideal basis for performing projections and other computations in that subspace.

We can also observe this when looking at the projection matrix onto the column space of $\boldsymbol{A}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{P} &= \boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{Q})^{-1}\boldsymbol{Q}^T \\
&= \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{Q}^T
\end{align*}
$$

Now, considering the QR decomposition $\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R}$, we can see that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Proj}_{\boldsymbol{C(A)}}\boldsymbol{A} &= \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{A} \\
&= \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{A} \\
&= \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R} \\
&= \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R} \\
&= \boldsymbol{A}
\end{align*}
$$

This confirms that $\boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R}$ accurately reconstructs $\boldsymbol{A}$, and the projection matrix 
$\boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{Q}^T$ preserves the structure of $\boldsymbol{A}$ within its column space.

Now let's also look at the null space of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{R}$.
The matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$ is an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal entries. This property is a direct consequence of the linear 
independence of the columns of $\boldsymbol{A}$. During the Gram-Schmidt process, each new vector $\boldsymbol{q}_k$ is orthogonalized with 
respect to all the previous vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_1, \boldsymbol{q}_2, \ldots, \boldsymbol{q}_{k-1}$. As a result, each diagonal entry $r_{kk}$ 
of $\boldsymbol{R}$ corresponds to the norm of the orthogonalized vector $\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}_k$, which is nonzero because the columns of 
$\boldsymbol{A}$ are linearly independent.

Since $\boldsymbol{R}$ is upper triangular with nonzero diagonal entries, it is invertible. The invertibility of $\boldsymbol{R}$ also ensures 
that the null space of $\boldsymbol{R}$ is trivial, i.e., $\text{N}(\boldsymbol{R}) = \{\boldsymbol{0}\}$. Consequently, the null space of 
$\boldsymbol{A}$ is also trivial because $\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R}$, and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is full rank.

### Applications of QR Decomposition

As we have already seen we can solve the least squares problem very easily with an orthonormal basis. If we are 
given a linear system of equations and the QR decomposition of the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$, we can also solve 
these systems efficiently. So suppose we want to solve the linear system of equations:

$$
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{b}.
$$

Using QR decomposition, we write $\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:

$$
\boldsymbol{Q}\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{b}.
$$

Left-multiplying both sides by $\boldsymbol{Q}^T$ because $\boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{Q} = \boldsymbol{I}$ the equation simplifies to:

$$
\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{b}.
$$

Since $\boldsymbol{R}$ is upper triangular, this system can then efficiently solved using **back substitution** and a matrix-vector 
multiplication. 

We can actually even further improve our solution for solving the least squares problem where we encounter an overdetermined system 
that doesn't have an exact solution. In this case, we seek a solution that minimizes the error, i.e., the **least squares solution**:  

$$
\min_{\boldsymbol{x}} \|\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{b}\|_2
$$

Using the QR decomposition, the least squares problem reduces to solving:

$$
\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{Q}^T\boldsymbol{b}.
$$

Again, this can then efficiently be solved using back substitution.
