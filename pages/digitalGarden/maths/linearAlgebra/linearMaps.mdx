# Linear Maps

also known as linear transformations, are functions between vector spaces that preserve the vector space operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, a linear map is a function that takes in vectors and outputs vectors.

## Matrices as Linear Maps

Also relates back to inverse matrices, as the inverse of a matrix is the matrix that undoes the transformation of the original matrix.

so linear maps are bijective, and thus invertible.
