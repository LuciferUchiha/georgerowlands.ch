# Linear Equations

## Simple Equations

Let's start with what is an equation? An equation is a statement where two expressions or terms are equal. To 
show this equality, we use the equal sign `=`.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
x + 2 &= 5 \\
y - 3 &= 7 \\
x^2 + 2x + 1 &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
