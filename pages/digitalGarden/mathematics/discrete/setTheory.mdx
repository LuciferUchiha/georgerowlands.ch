# Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects.
A set simply specifies the contents, the order is not important. $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same as $\{3,1,2\}$.

A set doesn't have to contain numbers, you could, for example, have a set of the base colors $\{red, green, blue\}$ you are not limited in this regard, Important is that they are distinct.

If we have the set $A=\{a,b,c\}$. To indicate that an object is an **element/member** of the set $A$ you write $a \in A$.
To indicate that an object is not an element of a set you write $z \notin A$.

Sets are characterized by their elements. Thus, two sets are only equal if they have the same elements. If $B=\{a,b,c\}$ then $A=B$. However $C=\{a,b,c,d\}$ and therefore $A \neq C$.

There is only one set with no elements at all, the **empty set**, and is represented by the symbol $\emptyset$. You may also see $\{\}$ being used.

## Notations

There are multiple ways to define a set.

### Roster Notation

The roster or also called enumeration notation defines a set by listing its elements between curly brackets separated by commas.

For example $A=\{1,2,3\}$

### Set-Builder Notation

This is probably the hardest notation to understand. The set-builder notation specifies a set as a selection from a larger set, determined by a condition on those elements.

For example $F = \{ a \mid a \text{ is an integer, and } 0 \leq a \leq 5\}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$
The vertical bar, "|" means "such that". So the description can be read as "F is the set of all numbers n such that n is an integer in the range from 0 to 5 inclusive.

### Semantic Definition

Sets can also be described using words and rules.

Let $A$ be the first 3 positive integers that are odd. So $A=\{1,3,5\}$
Let $B$ be the set of colors of the French flag. So $B=\{red,green,blue\}$

## Sets of Numbers

A good visualization for the set of numbers.

![setOfNumbers](/maths/setOfNumbers.png)

### Natural Numbers

$\Bbb{N} =\{0, 1,2,3,...\}$ some authors do not include 0 in the set of natural numbers. These authors then use the following notation to include 0 $\Bbb{N}_0 =\{0,1,2,3,..\}$. I prefer to include 0 and in the special cases where I do not want it to be included I can use set subtraction/difference $\Bbb{N} \setminus \{0\} = \{1,2,3,...\}$.

### Integers

$\Bbb{Z} =\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$

Multiple variations and combinations are also possible:

- $\Bbb{Z}^+ =\{1,2,3,...\}=\Bbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}^- =\{...,-3,-2,-1\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}_0^+ =\{0,1,2,3,...\}=\Bbb{N}$ combinations are also possible.

### Rational and Irrational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed with a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not equal
to zero. Another way to remember them is that they can be written as terminating or repeating decimals.

$$
\Bbb{Q}=\Big\{\frac{p}{q} \mid p \in \Bbb{Z} \land q \in \Bbb{Z} \setminus \{0\} \Big\}
$$

<Callout type="example">
The number $0.75$ is a rational number because it can be written as a fraction of two integers:

$$
\frac{3}{4}
$$

This fraction is also unique to each number, as for example the fraction $\frac{6}{8}$ can be shortened to the above
solution by dividing the denominator an nominator by the common factor 2.

Another example is $0.3333... = 0.\overline{3}$, which can also be written as a fraction of two integers:

$$
\frac{1}{3}
$$
</Callout>

On the other hand, irrational numbers $\Bbb{I}$ are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. They cannot
be written as terminating or repeating decimals, as their decimal expansions go on infinitely without repeating.

<Callout type="example">
For example, $\pi$, is an irrational number for obvious reasons:

$$
\pi = 3.14159265...
$$

Another example is $\sqrt{2}$, which can also be proven:

$$
\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356...
$$

This however does not mean that all square roots are irrational numbers!

$$
\sqrt{9} = 3 \in \Bbb{N}
$$

</Callout>

#### Proof $\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational

To prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, we need to assume that it is rational and then derive a contradiction.
That is, we assume that $\sqrt{2}$ can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, and then show that this assumption leads
to a contradiction. Suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, and can be expressed as:

$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}
$$

where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors. We can assume that $p$ and $q$ are in lowest terms, meaning that
they have been divided by their greatest common factor. After squaring both sides of this equation, we get:

$$
2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}
$$

Then multiplying both sides by $q^2$, we get:

$$
2q^2 = p^2
$$

This means that $p^2$ is even, which implies that $p$ is also even (because the square of an odd number is odd). So we
can write $p$ as $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $p = 2k$ into the equation $2q^2 = p^2$, we get:

$$
2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
$$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$$
q^2 = 2k^2
$$

This means that $q^2$ is even, which implies that $q$ is also even (because the square of an odd number is odd). But
this contradicts our assumption that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors, since they both have a factor of 2. Therefore,
our initial assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false, and we conclude that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

### Real Numbers

Real numbers are the combination of rational and irrational numbers.

$$
\Bbb{R} = \Bbb{Q} \cap \Bbb{I}
$$

<Callout type="warning">
Infinity is not a number in the traditional sense, but rather a concept that refers to something, limitless i.e. without
end. Therefore it is not an element of any set of numbers, including the real numbers.
</Callout>

### Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers is denoted with $\Bbb{C}$. You can see what complex numbers are and how they are used on [this page](../Komplexe%20Zahlen/KomplexeZahlenDetailliert.md) or also just look at a [cheat sheet](../Komplexe%20Zahlen/KomplexeZahlenCheatsheet.md) to refresh your knowledge (will however be in german).

## Sub and Superset

$A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$. $B$ is then a so called **superset** of $A$.

In the above case It is possible for $A$ and $B$ to be equal. if they are unequal but a subset, then $A$ is a so called **proper subset** of $B$.

The notations for the relations mentioned above can be very different see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset#%E2%8A%82_and_%E2%8A%83_symbols).
I will however be using the following notations:

- For $A$ is a **subset** of $B$: $A \subseteq B$
- For $B$ is a **superset** of $A$: $B \supseteq A$
- For $A$ is a **proper subset** of $B$: $A \subset B$
- For $B$ is a **proper superset** of $A$: $B \supset A$

It's a big help if you imagine sets as circles by doing so you can easily visualize things like the following:
![subsetAndProperSubset](/maths/subsets.png)

Notice that $\emptyset \subseteq A$, for any set $A$.

## Ordered Pair

An **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is different from the ordered pair $(b,a)$ unless$a=b$. In contrast, the unordered pair $\{a,b\}$ equals the unordered pair $\{b,a\}$.

## Basic Set Operations

There are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given sets.

### Union

Two sets can be joined together, this results in the so called **union** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cup B$. The union is the set containing all elements that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.

![union](/maths/union.png)

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2\} \cup \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cup \{2,3\} &= \{1,2,3\} \\
\{1,2,3\} \cup \{3,4,5\} &= \{1,2,3,4,5\}
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Intersection

A new set can also be constructed by determining which elements two sets have "in common", this results in the so called **intersection** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cap B$. The intersection is the set of all things that are elements of both $A$ and $B$. If $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then $A$ and $B$ are called **disjoint**.

![intersection](/maths/intersection.png)

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2\} \cap \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} &= \{2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Complements

The so called **absolute complement** of $A$ (or simply the **complement of** $A$) is the set of elements not in $A$. In other words, let $U$ be a set that contains all the elements under study. If there is no need to mention $U$, either because it has been previously specified, or it is obvious (for example all positive numbers). Then the absolute complement of $A$ is the difference (Or relative complement) of $A$ in $U$.
This can be written as $A^c = U \setminus A$.

![absoluteComplement](/maths/absoluteComplement.png)

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2\} \cap \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} &= \{2\} \\
\{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

### Difference

If $B$ and $A$ are sets, then the **relative complement** (or short **difference**) of $B$ and $A$, is the set of elements in $B$ without the elements of $A$.
This can be written as $B \setminus A$.

![difference](/maths/difference.png)

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
\{1,2,3\} \setminus \{2,3,4\} &= \{1\} \\
\{2,3,4\} \setminus \{1,2,3\} &= \{4\} \\
\{1,2,3\} \setminus \{1,2,3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

#### Symmetric Difference

The **symmetric difference** of two sets (also known as the **disjunctive union**), is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in both sets (their intersection).
This can be written as $A \ominus B$ or $A \triangle B$ which can however cause confussion with other subjects.
The symmetric difference can be defined as $A \ominus B=(A \cup B)\setminus (A \cap B)$ or as $(A \setminus B)\cup(B \setminus A)$.

![symmetricDifference](/maths/symmetricDifference.png)

<Callout type="example">
$$
\{7,8,9,10\} \ominus \{9,10,11,12\} = \{7,8, 11,12\}
$$
</Callout>

### Cartesian Product

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ is an element of $A$ and $b$ is an element of $B$. So in short a set of all of the possible combinations.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\{1,2\} \times \{3,4\} = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}
$$
</Callout>

## Cardinality

The cardinality of a set $A$ is the number of elements/members of $A$. This can be written as $|A|$.

If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ then $|A|=3$

Repeated elementes in roster notation are not counted, so $B=\{blue, white, red, blue, white\}$ then $|B|=3$

## Power Set

The power set or also called super set of a set $A$ is the set containing all subsets of $A$. The empty set and $A$ itself are also elements of the power set of $A$, because these are also both subsets of $A$.

The power set of the set $A$ is commonly written as $P(A)$ or $2^{A}$

<Callout type="example">
Given $A={x,y,z}$:

$$
S^A=P(A)=\{\emptyset,\{x\},\{y\},\{z\},\{x,y\},\{x,z\},\{y,z\},\{x,y,z\}\}
$$
</Callout>

### Cardinality of a Power Set

The amount of elements in a power set is pretty easy to calculate. If $|A|=3$ as in the example above then $|P(A)|=2^3=8$ which can simplified to $|P(A)|=2^{|A|}$, this is why I prefer to use the $P(A)$ notation as the other notation can quickly cause confusion.

## Partitions

A partition of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $A$ such that every element $a \in A$ is in exactly one of these subsets.

The set $P$ is only a partition of $A$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:

- P does not contain the empty set, so $\emptyset \notin P$.
- The union of all the sets in $P$ is equal to $A$.
- The intersection of any two distinct sets in $P$ is the empty set, $\emptyset$

<Callout type="example">
The set $\{1,2,3\}$ has 5 possible partitions:

- $\{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$
- $\{\{1\},\{2,3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2,3\}\}$

The following are not partitions of \{1,2,3\}:

- $\{\emptyset,\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition because one of its elements is the empty set.
- $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$ is not a partition because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
- $\{\{1\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition of $\{1,2,3\}$ because none of its blocks contains the element 3.
