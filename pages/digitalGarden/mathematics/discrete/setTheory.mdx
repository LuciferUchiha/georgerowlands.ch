# Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects.
A set simply specifies the contents, the order is not important. $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same as $\{3,1,2\}$.

A set doesn't have to contain numbers, you could, for example, have a set of the base colors $\{red, green, blue\}$ you are not limited in this regard, Important is that they are distinct.

If we have the set $A=\{a,b,c\}$. To indicate that an object is an **element/member** of the set $A$ you write $a \in A$.
To indicate that an object is not an element of a set you write $z \notin A$.

Sets are characterized by their elements. Thus, two sets are only equal if they have the same elements. If $B=\{a,b,c\}$ then $A=B$. However $C=\{a,b,c,d\}$ and therefore $A \neq C$.

There is only one set with no elements at all, the **empty set**, and is represented by the symbol $\emptyset$. You may also see $\{\}$ being used.

## Notations

There are multiple ways to define a set.

### Roster Notation

The roster or also called enumeration notation defines a set by listing its elements between curly brackets separated by commas.

For example $A=\{1,2,3\}$

### Set-Builder Notation

This is probably the hardest notation to understand. The set-builder notation specifies a set as a selection from a larger set, determined by a condition on those elements.

For example $F = \{ a \mid a \text{ is an integer, and } 0 \leq a \leq 5\}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$
The vertical bar, "|" means "such that". So the description can be read as "F is the set of all numbers n such that n is an integer in the range from 0 to 5 inclusive.

### Semantic Definition

Sets can also be described using words and rules.

Let $A$ be the first 3 positive integers that are odd. So $A=\{1,3,5\}$
Let $B$ be the set of colors of the French flag. So $B=\{red,green,blue\}$

## Sets of Numbers

A good visualization for the set of numbers.

### Natural Numbers

$\Bbb{N} =\{0, 1,2,3,...\}$ some authors do not include 0 in the set of natural numbers. These authors then use the following notation to include 0 $\Bbb{N}_0 =\{0,1,2,3,..\}$. I prefer to include 0 and in the special cases where I do not want it to be included I can use set subtraction/difference $\Bbb{N} \setminus \{0\} = \{1,2,3,...\}$.

### Integers

$\Bbb{Z} =\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}$

Multiple variations and combinations are also possible:

- $\Bbb{Z}^+ =\{1,2,3,...\}=\Bbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}^- =\{...,-3,-2,-1\}$
- $\Bbb{Z}_0^+ =\{0,1,2,3,...\}=\Bbb{N}$ combinations are also possible.

### Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers is denoted with $\Bbb{C}$. You can see what complex numbers are and how they are used on [this page](../Komplexe%20Zahlen/KomplexeZahlenDetailliert.md) or also just look at a [cheat sheet](../Komplexe%20Zahlen/KomplexeZahlenCheatsheet.md) to refresh your knowledge (will however be in german).

## Sub and Superset

$A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$. $B$ is then a so called **superset** of $A$.

In the above case It is possible for $A$ and $B$ to be equal. if they are unequal but a subset, then $A$ is a so called **proper subset** of $B$.

The notations for the relations mentioned above can be very different see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset#%E2%8A%82_and_%E2%8A%83_symbols).
I will however be using the following notations:

- For $A$ is a **subset** of $B$: $A \subseteq B$
- For $B$ is a **superset** of $A$: $B \supseteq A$
- For $A$ is a **proper subset** of $B$: $A \subset B$
- For $B$ is a **proper superset** of $A$: $B \supset A$

It's a big help if you imagine sets as circles by doing so you can easily visualize things like the following:
![subsetAndProperSubset](/maths/subsets.png)

Notice that $\emptyset \subseteq A$, for any set $A$.

## Ordered Pair

An **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is different from the ordered pair $(b,a)$ unless$a=b$. In contrast, the unordered pair $\{a,b\}$ equals the unordered pair $\{b,a\}$.

## Basic Set Operations

There are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given sets.

### Union

Two sets can be joined together, this results in the so called **union** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cup B$. The union is the set containing all elements that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.

![union](/maths/union.png)

:::example

$$\begin{align*}
    \{1,2\} \cup \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
    \{1,2\} \cup \{2,3\} &= \{1,2,3\} \\
    \{1,2,3\} \cup \{3,4,5\} &= \{1,2,3,4,5\}
\end{align*}$$

:::

### Intersection

A new set can also be constructed by determining which elements two sets have "in common", this results in the so called **intersection** of $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cap B$. The intersection is the set of all things that are elements of both $A$ and $B$. If $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then $A$ and $B$ are called **disjoint**.

![intersection](/maths/intersection.png)

:::example

$$\begin{align*}
    \{1,2\} \cap \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
    \{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} &= \{2\} \\
    \{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}$$

:::

### Complements

The so called **absolute complement** of $A$ (or simply the **complement of** $A$) is the set of elements not in $A$. In other words, let $U$ be a set that contains all the elements under study. If there is no need to mention $U$, either because it has been previously specified, or it is obvious (for example all positive numbers). Then the absolute complement of $A$ is the difference (Or relative complement) of $A$ in $U$.
This can be written as $A^c = U \setminus A$.

![absoluteComplement](/maths/absoluteComplement.png)

:::example

$$\begin{align*}
    \{1,2\} \cap \{1,2\} &= \{1,2\} \\
    \{1,2\} \cap \{2,3\} &= \{2\} \\
    \{1,2\} \cap \{3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}$$

:::

### Difference

If $B$ and $A$ are sets, then the **relative complement** (or short **difference**) of $B$ and $A$, is the set of elements in $B$ without the elements of $A$.
This can be written as $B \setminus A$.

![difference](/maths/difference.png)

:::example

$$\begin{align*}
    \{1,2,3\} \setminus \{2,3,4\} &= \{1\} \\
    \{2,3,4\} \setminus \{1,2,3\} &= \{4\} \\
    \{1,2,3\} \setminus \{1,2,3,4\} &= \emptyset
\end{align*}$$

:::

#### Symmetric Difference

The **symmetric difference** of two sets (also known as the **disjunctive union**), is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in both sets (their intersection).
This can be written as $A \ominus B$ or $A \triangle B$ which can however cause confussion with other subjects.
The symmetric difference can be defined as $A \ominus B=(A \cup B)\setminus (A \cap B)$ or as $(A \setminus B)\cup(B \setminus A)$.

![symmetricDifference](/maths/symmetricDifference.png)

:::example

$$\{7,8,9,10\} \ominus \{9,10,11,12\} = \{7,8, 11,12\}$$

:::

### Cartesian Product

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ is an element of $A$ and $b$ is an element of $B$. So in short a set of all of the possible combinations.

:::example

$$\{1,2\} \times \{3,4\} = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}$$

:::

## Cardinality

The cardinality of a set $A$ is the number of elements/members of $A$. This can be written as $|A|$.

If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ then $|A|=3$

Repeated elementes in roster notation are not counted, so $B=\{blue, white, red, blue, white\}$ then $|B|=3$

## Power Set

The power set or also called super set of a set $A$ is the set containing all subsets of $A$. The empty set and $A$ itself are also elements of the power set of $A$, because these are also both subsets of $A$.

The power set of the set $A$ is commonly written as $P(A)$ or $2^{A}$

:::example

Given $A={x,y,z}$:

$$S^A=P(A)=\{\emptyset,\{x\},\{y\},\{z\},\{x,y\},\{x,z\},\{y,z\},\{x,y,z\}\}$$

:::

### Cardinality of a Power Set

The amount of elements in a power set is pretty easy to calculate. If $|A|=3$ as in the example above then $|P(A)|=2^3=8$ which can simplified to $|P(A)|=2^{|A|}$, this is why I prefer to use the $P(A)$ notation as the other notation can quickly cause confusion.

## Partitions

A partition of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $A$ such that every element $a \in A$ is in exactly one of these subsets.

The set $P$ is only a partition of $A$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:

- P does not contain the empty set, so $\emptyset \notin P$.
- The union of all the sets in $P$ is equal to $A$.
- The intersection of any two distinct sets in $P$ is the empty set, $\emptyset$

:::example

The set $\{1,2,3\}$ has 5 possible partitions:

- $\{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$
- $\{\{1\},\{2,3\}\}$
- $\{\{1,2,3\}\}$

The following are not partitions of \{1,2,3\}:

- $\{\emptyset,\{1,3\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition because one of its elements is the empty set.
- $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$ is not a partition because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
- $\{\{1\},\{2\}\}$ is not a partition of $\{1,2,3\}$ because none of its blocks contains the element 3.
