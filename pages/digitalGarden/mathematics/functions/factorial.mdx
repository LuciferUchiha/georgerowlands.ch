# Factorial

The factorial is a function that is defined only for non-negative integers $n$. The factorial of a number is written as
$n!$, and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.

$$
n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)\cdot ... \cdot 2 \cdot 1
$$

or alternatively,

$$
n! = \prod_{x=1}^{n}{x}
$$

<Callout type="example" title="Example">
$5!=5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
An important and only exception to this function is that $0! = 1$.
