    "The hadamard product is denoted using $\\mathbf{A} \\odot \\mathbf{B}$ and is also commonly known as the element-wise matrix multiplication which perfectly describes how it works. It is defined for two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ of the same dimensions and results in another matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ that has the same dimension as the two input matrices so $\\mathbf{A, B, C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$. So each element at $i,j$ in the resulting matrix is the product of the elements at $i,j$ of the two input matrices.\n",

    "But as might notice this is the hadamard product/element-wise multiplication. You would get the same result if you used the [`np.multiply(A,B)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.multiply.html) function as this is the function that is called under the hood when using the `*` operator. If you really did want to multiply $\\mathbf{A}$ with $\\mathbf{B}$ you would need to use the `@` operator or [`np.matmul(A,B)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) function.\n",
