# Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers that are either very large or very small in a short and convenient
form. The scientific notation takes the following form:

$$
s \cdot 10^n
$$

where $s$ is the so-called significand or mantissa and is multiplied with 10 to the power of $n$, the exponent. If the
number is negative then a minus sign precedes the significand $s$.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
2 &= 2 \cdot 10^0 \\
300 &= 300 \cdot 10^0 = 30 \cdot 10^1 = 3 \cdot 10^2 \\
-10.5 &= -1.5 \cdot 10^1
\end{align*}
$$
</Callout>

## Normalized Notation

As you can see in the second example there can be some ambiguity which is why the normalized notation was introduced.
In the normalized form the exponent is chosen so that the significand is at least 1 but less than 10, so $M \in [1,10)$.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\begin{align*}
2 &= 2 \cdot 10^0 \\
300 &= 3 \cdot 10^2 \\
-53'000 &= -5.3 \cdot 10^4 \\
0.2 &= 2 \cdot 10^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$
