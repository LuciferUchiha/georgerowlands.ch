    "Broadcasting is something special that computer scientists make use of when working with tensors such as scalars, vectors and matrices. It's very useful for computer scientists but it is not really mathematical. It allows libraries like numpy to perform arithmetic operations (element-wise addition or multiplication, also known as [hadamard product](./hadamardProduct.md)) although the arrays have different shapes. If the arrays meet certain constraints then the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes to perform the operation. Let's look at some simple examples of how [broadcasting in numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) works. We might often want to perform the element-wise multiplication between two different arrays, in this case, vectors of the same shape this works fine."
