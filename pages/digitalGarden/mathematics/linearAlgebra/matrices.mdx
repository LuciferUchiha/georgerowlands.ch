# Matrices

You can think of a matrix as rectangle of objects arranged in rows and columns, like a chessboard. For computer scientist you can also imagine a matrix as a
2D array. A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called an $m \times n$ matrix. The number of rows and columns therefore define the size or dimensions of a matrix.
The objects in a matrix or commonly reffered to as elements or entries. A matrix containing only real numbered elements is called a real matrix and can be defined as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The elements of a matrix are indexed by their row and then there column. So $a_{ij}$ is the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column. This means that a matrix can also be 
defined as $\boldsymbol{A} = [a_{ij}]_{1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq j \leq n}$.

<Callout type="example">
    $$ 
    \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
    $$
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    The number of rows and columns of a matrix are always written in the order of rows first and columns second! So a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is written 
    as a $2 \times 3$ matrix, not a $3 \times 2$ matrix, so $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 3}$.
</Callout>

A matrix with only one row is called a row vector and a matrix with only one column is called a column vector. For some applications it is useful to of a normal vector as a 
column vector. 

<Callout type="example">
    A column vector, i.e. a normal vector, can be written as follows:

    $$
    \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} = \begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    A row vector can be written as follows:

    $$
    \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times n} = \begin{bmatrix}v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n \end{bmatrix}
    $$
</Callout>

## Transpose

The transpose of a matrix is a matrix where the rows and columns are swapped. The transpose of the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is written as $\boldsymbol{A}^T$. 
Formally the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column in the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ becomes the element in the $j$-th row and $i$-th column in the 
matrix $\boldsymbol{A}^T$. So $a_{ij}^T = a_{ji}$.

<Callout type="example">
    Transposing a column vector:
    $$
    \boldsymbol{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
    v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n 
    \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{v}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
    v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n 
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    Transposing a row vector:
    $$
    \boldsymbol{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
    v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n 
    \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{v}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
    v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n 
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    Transposing a matrix:
    $$
    \boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
    4 & 5 & 6 
    \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 4 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    3 & 6
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
</Callout>

As we can see in the example above the transpose of a row vector is a column vector and the transpose of a column vector is a row vector. This also shows that 
transposing a matrix results in a matrix with its dimensions swapped. So the transpose of a $m \times n$ matrix is a $n \times m$ matrix.

### Properties

#### Transposing a Transposed Matrix

If a matrix is transposed twice it is the same as the original matrix:

$$
(\boldsymbol{A}^T)^T = \boldsymbol{A}
$$

<Callout type="example">
$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
4 & 5 & 6 
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6 
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow (\boldsymbol{A}^T)^T = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
4 & 5 & 6 
\end{bmatrix} = \boldsymbol{A}
$$

### Transposing on a Computer

When you want the transpose of a matrix you don't actually need to perform any operations. You can just change the way you access the elements of the matrix. Rather than
accessing the elements row by row you can access them column by column.

Depending on the size of the matrix and how many times you need to access the elements of the matrix this can be a lot faster than actually transposing the matrix. However, 
if you need to access the elements of the matrix multiple times it is probably faster to transpose the matrix first and then access the elements due to memory locality.

To transpose a square matrix in-place you can use the following algorithm which you can think of as swapping the elements of the matrix along the diagonal:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        swap(A[i][j], A[j][i]);
    }
}
```

For a non-square matrix you need to use a slightly different algorithm.

## Types of Matrices

There are a number of different types of matrices that are used in linear algebra. We will discuss some of the most common ones here.

### Square Matrix

As you can imagine a square matrix is a matrix where the number of rows and columns are equal. So a square matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix. Square matrices have 
a number of useful properties and are therefore often used in many different applications.

$$
\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Triangular Matrix

The diagonal elements of a matrix are the elements where the row and column index are equal. So $a_{ii}$ is a diagonal element. A triangular matrix is a matrix where all the 
elements above or below the diagonal are $0$. If all the elements above the diagonal are $0$ it is called a **lower triangular matrix** becuase it only has elements below the 
diagonal that are non-zero. If all the elements below the diagonal are $0$ it is called a **upper triangular matrix** because it only has elements above the diagonal that are
non-zero.

<Callout type="example">
A lower triangular matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 3 & 0 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

An upper triangular matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</Callout>

#### Diagonal Matrix

### Identity Matrix

### Symmetric Matrix

If a matrix is equal to its transpose it is called a symmetric matrix. So $\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{A}^T$ and for each element in the matrix $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$.
As you can quite easily imagine a prerequisite for a matrix to be symmetric is that it is a square matrix as otherwise the transpose of the matrix would have different dimensions.

Another thing that makes sense is that a diagonal matrix is always symmetric as all the elements that are not on the diagonal are zero.

<Callout type="example">
A symmetric matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix} = \boldsymbol{A}
$$

A diagonal matrix is also symmetric:

$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix} = \boldsymbol{A}
$$
</Callout>

#### Skew-Symmetric Matrix

A skew-symmetric matrix is a matrix where the elements of the matrix are equal to the negative of the elements in the transpose of the matrix. 
So $\boldsymbol{A} = -\boldsymbol{A}^T$ and for each element in the matrix $a_{ij} = -a_{ji}$.

<Callout type="example">
$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 & -3 \\
-2 & 0 & 5 \\
3 & -5 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -2 & 3 \\
2 & 0 & -5 \\
-3 & 5 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = -\boldsymbol{A}
$$
</Callout>
