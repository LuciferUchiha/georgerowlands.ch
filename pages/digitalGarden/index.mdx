# My Digital Garden

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a mix between a notebook and a blog, it is a place to share thoughts and cultivate them into a garden.
It also allows me to have a place where I can store my notes/summaries/tutorials for my studies.

The main difference to a blog is that a blog has articles and publication dates and never changes after it has been
published, whereas a digital garden is a place where the written content can be continuously edited and refined. The
notes are also very free flowing they can span from just a short cheatsheet to a full set of notes on an entire subject
where you go into every nitty-gritty detail.

Another key difference is the navigation. A blog is usually read in chronological order but a digital garden can be read
in any order you want and uses lots of internal links to connect all the notes into a Network (although this can be
quite hard to diligently do).

## How is my Garden Built?

### Docusaurus

<Callout type="info">
This is no longer how my digital garden is built and is therefore no longer supported or updated. It is however
still
available under [old.georgerowlands.ch](https://old.georgerowlands.ch/).
</Callout>

My notes are written using the Markdown format which is the most common way for a computer scientist to write texts apart
from LaTeX for academic purposes. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is built by Facebook, now Meta, that takes these
markdown files and builds them into a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app for me. If you don't know what a React app is,
in short, it is the most popular way to build a professional website at the current time of writing. I used to write my
markdown notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and then built them into a web app using
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) but decided to
move over to using Docusaurus for the added flexibility of it being a React app.

Most recently I also added the capability of converting Jupyter Notebooks with a python kernel to markdown files so that
they can then also be built to react pages. This was done using [nbdoc](https://outerbounds.github.io/nbdoc/) which is
an adapted version of [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev).

Some potential future features that I am thinking of looking into is being able to convert Jupyter Notebooks with a
Java kernel to markdown. I am also interested in being able to convert Matlab Scripts and LaTeX files to Markdown to
then be nicely rendered.

### Nextra

This is how the current iteration of my digital garden is built. [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) is a very similar
framework to Docusaurus that builds markdown files to a React app. The main differences being that it is built by Vercel
and that it is in my opinion built a lot simpler and modern than Docusaurus.

Current improvements from the the previous docusaurus iteration is mainly that the Jupyter Notebook convert is a custom
NBConvert converter built by me so i have control over the templates and could generate `.mdx` rather than just `.md` files.

## The Features

This section is to show off some features of what can be rendered in my digital garden.

### Markdown

Markdown is supported out of the box with its many features.

### MDX

In addition to normal markdown Nextra also supports the MDX format which allows you to write JSX, i.e. react code in a
markdown file. To find out more about MDX check out the official [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).

#### Admonitions / Callouts

Admonitions aren't included in standard markdown but have become very popular and are very useful and are supported
by Nextra. Admonitions allow you to highlight certain text and add a category to the text for example:

```
<Callout type="warning">
This Is a big scary warning.
</Callout>
```

Renders to:

<Callout type="warning">
This Is a big scary warning.
</Callout>

You can also change the title of the banner:

```
<Callout type="info" title="The following types are supported">
info, warning, error, example, todo
</Callout>
```

<Callout type="info" title="The following types are supported">
info, warning, error, example, todo
</Callout>

### LaTeX

It has recently become very popular to write LaTeX equations in markdown. Nextra also supports this by using KaTeX to
render LaTeX content either inline between `$\LaTeX$` $\LaTeX$ or as a block between `$$I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx$$`:

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$

Annoyingly Jupyter Notebooks use MathJax to render LaTeX content in the same way instead of KaTeX. This means that KaTeX
supports some things and MathJax supports other things. Importantly however is that the Jupyter Notebooks get converted
to Markdown and therefore in the end it will only be rendered in KaTeX.

Therefore, if something is written that is supported in MathJax but not in KaTeX it might look okay but in the end,
it will not be rendered by KaTeX. This leads to [my LaTeX Notation Guideline](./mathematics/latexGuidelines) to avoid
conflicts whilst still keeping nice Formulas.

You can see what is supported by KaTeX [here,](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) and you can see what is supported
by MathJax [here](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html).

### PlantUML

If you ever need to create diagrams and especially UML diagrams, PlantUML is the way to go. I started with using Mermaid
to create UML diagrams but swapped to PlantUML for the additional features and the ability to create custom themes
(so everything can be minimalist and purple :D).

To render PlantUML diagrams the [Remark plugin Simple PlantUML](https://github.com/akebifiky/remark-simple-plantuml) is
used which uses the official PlantUML server to generate an image and then adds it.

Some Examples can be seen below, on the [official website](https://plantuml.com/) or on [REAL WORLD PlantUML](https://real-world-plantuml.com/?type=class).

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

interface Command {
    execute()
    undo()
}
class Invoker{
    setCommand()
}
class Client
class Receiver{
    action()
}
class ConcreteCommand{
    execute()
    undo()
}

Command <|-down- ConcreteCommand
Client -right-> Receiver
Client --> ConcreteCommand
Invoker o-right-> Command
Receiver <-left- ConcreteCommand

@enduml
```

<br/>

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

state Elevator {
Stopped -right-> Moving : Next Stop
Moving --> Stopped : No More Stops
Moving --> Moving : Has More Stops
}

@enduml

```

My custom theme also has some processes built in for simple text coloring for example in cases of success, failure etc.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

Bob -> Alice :  normal
Bob <- Alice :  $success("success: Hi Bob")
Bob -x Alice :  $failure("failure")
Bob ->> Alice : $warning("warning")
Bob ->> Alice : $info("finished")

@enduml
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

<Callout type="todo">
TODO add how the hound works and how to use it.
</Callout>

## How can I Contribute?

Do you enjoy the content and want to contribute to the garden by adding some new plants or watering the existing ones?
Then feel free to make a pull request. There are however some rules to keep in mind before adding or changing content.

- Markdown filenames and folders are written in camelCase.
- Titles should follow the
[IEEE Editorial Style Manual](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/style_references_manual.pdf).
They should also be added to the markdown file and specified in the `_meta.json` which maps files to titles and is also
responsible for the ordering.
A possible feature in the future could be a GitHub action that automatically checks this and creates a pull request fixing all the errors.
and markdown rules are followed. A possible future feature would be a linter as a GitHub action.
- LaTeX should conform with my notation and guideline, if something is not defined there you can of course add it.
