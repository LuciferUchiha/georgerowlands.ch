# My Digital Garden

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a mix between a notebook and a blog, it is a place to share thoughts and cultivate them into a garden.
It also allows me to have a place where I can store my notes/summaries/tutorials for my studies.

The main difference to a blog is that a blog has articles and publication dates and never changes after it has been published,
whereas a digital garden is a place where the written content can be continuously edited and refined. The notes are also very free flowing they
can span from just a short cheatsheet to a full set of notes on an entire subject where you go into every nitty-gritty detail.

Another key difference is the navigation. A blog is usually read in chronological order but a digital garden can be read in any order you want and uses
lots of internal links to connect all the notes into a Network (although this can be quite hard to diligently do).

If you are interested in learning more about digital gardens I can recommend the following

## How was my Garden Built?

My notes are written using the Markdown format which is the most common way for a computer scientist to write texts apart from LaTeX for academic purposes.
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) built by Facebook, now Meta, then takes these markdown files and builds them into a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app for me.
If you don't know what a React app is, in short, it is the most popular way to build a professional website at the current time of writing.
I used to write my markdown notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and then built them into a web app using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the
[Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) but decided to move over to using Docusaurus for the added flexibility
of it being a react app. Now I write my notes using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (also for the additional flexibility) with the following plugins:

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint), which is also set as the formatter for `.md`

Most recently I also added the capability of converting Jupyter Notebooks with a python kernel to markdown files so that they can then also be built
to react pages. This was done using [nbdoc](https://outerbounds.github.io/nbdoc/) which is an adapted version of [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev).

Some potential future features that I am thinking of looking into is being able to convert Jupyter Notebooks with a Java kernel to markdown. I am also interested
in being able to convert Matlab Scripts and LaTeX files to markdown to then be nicely rendered.

## The Features

This section is to show off some of the features of what can be rendered with Docusaurus.

### Markdown

Docusaurus supports markdown out of the box and its many features. For a brief overview of what it supports check out the
[docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

#### Admonitions

Admonitions aren't included in standard markdown but have become very popular and are very useful and are supported by Docusaurus. Admonitions allow you to highlight certain text
and add a category to the text for example:

```
:::caution

This Is a big scary warning.

:::
```

Renders to:

:::caution

This Is a big scary warning.

:::

You can also change the title of the banner:

```
:::info The following types are supported

note, tip, danger, info, caution

:::
```

:::info The following types are supported

note, tip, danger, info, caution

:::

I have also added some custom admonition types but I haven't quite figured out how to get custom colors for them:

:::example

:::todo

To find out more check out the [Docusaurus documentation on Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions).

### MDX

In addition to normal markdown Docusaurus also supports the MDX format which allows you to write JSX, i.e react code in a markdown file.
To find out more about MDX check out the [Docusaurus documentation on MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react) and the official [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).

### LaTeX

It has recently become very popular to write LaTeX equations in markdown. Docusaurus also supports this by using KaTeX to render LaTeX content either inline
between `$\LaTeX$` $\LaTeX$ or as a block between `$$I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx$$`:

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$

Annoyingly Jupyter Notebooks use MathJax to render LaTeX content in the same way instead of KaTeX. This means that KaTeX supports some things and MathJax
supports other things. Importantly however is that the Jupyter Notebooks get converted to Markdown and therefore in the end it will only be rendered in KaTeX.
Therefore if something is written that is supported in MathJax but not in KaTeX it might look okay but in the end, it will not be rendered by Docusaurus.
This leads to the task below since I want the latex to be rendered correctly when working inside the Jupyter Notebook but in the end only the LaTeX that
can be rendered by KaTeX and will be readable.

You can see what is supported by KaTeX [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) and you can see what is supported by MathJax [here](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html).

You can find my [notation guideline and LaTeX cheat sheet](./Mathematik/latex) that is compatible with KaTeX and MathJax

### PlantUML

If you ever need to create diagrams and especially UML diagrams, PlantUML is the way to go. I started with using Mermaid to create UML diagrams
but swapped to PlantUML for the additional features and the ability to create my custom theme (so everything can be minimalist and purple :D).

The current implementation to render the diagrams is built upon [Remark Simple PlantUML](https://github.com/akebifiky/remark-simple-plantuml). It allows you to create
PlantUML diagrams in markdown code blocks with the plantuml language.

Some Examples can be seen below, on the [official website](https://plantuml.com/) or on [REAL WORLD PlantUML](https://real-world-plantuml.com/?type=class).

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

interface Command {
    execute()
    undo()
}
class Invoker{
    setCommand()
}
class Client
class Receiver{
    action()
}
class ConcreteCommand{
    execute()
    undo()
}

Command <|-down- ConcreteCommand
Client -right-> Receiver
Client --> ConcreteCommand
Invoker o-right-> Command
Receiver <-left- ConcreteCommand

@enduml
```

<br />

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

state Elevator {
Stopped -right-> Moving : Next Stop
Moving --> Stopped : No More Stops
Moving --> Moving : Has More Stops
}

@enduml

```

My custom theme also has some processes built in for simple text coloring for example in cases of success, failure etc.

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

Bob -> Alice :  normal
Bob <- Alice :  $success("success: Hi Bob")
Bob -x Alice :  $failure("failure")
Bob ->> Alice : $warning("warning")
Bob ->> Alice : $info("finished")

@enduml
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

:::todo

Explain how Jupyter Notebooks get converted to markdown. But I currently don't really like how all this is done which is making me think of creating
my own static site generator where I can then freely add pre processors such as jupyter notebooks to markdown of any kernel or R notebooks etc.

:::

## How can I Contribute?

Do you enjoy the content and want to contribute to the garden by adding some new plants or watering the existing ones?

Then this is the place to find out how to do so. There are however some prerequisites and rules.

- You will need a GitHub account and basic knowledge of git and creating pull requests.
- You will need basic knowledge of how to write Markdown and LaTeX if working with math equations.
- To add or change interactive things knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is required.
- To add or change the content of Jupyter Notebooks you will of course need basic knowledge of Python, Jupyter Notebooks and preferably docker.

### Style Guide

There are however some rules to keep in mind before adding or changing content.

- Markdown filenames are written in camelCase.
- If there needs to be a certain order of the pages because it would make more sense then you can prefix the file name with `n-filename` or add in
  the frontmatter `sidebar_position: 1`.
- The title (used in the sidebar etc.) should be set using frontmatter for every page at the beginning.
- Titles should follow the [IEEE Editorial Style Manual](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/style_references_manual.pdf).
  A possible feature in the future could be a GitHub action that automatically checks this and creates a pull request fixing all the errors.
- Use the [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) extension to make sure the formatting
  and markdown rules are followed. A possible future feature would be a linter as a GitHub action.
- LaTeX should confirm with my notation and cheat sheet, if something is not there defined there you can add on to it.

### Changing or Adding Content

#### Markdown

If you have found a mistake, be it a spelling mistake or something related to the content. Or maybe you just want to add more content to an existing
page or even add a new page and you don't need more than Markdown. Then you can follow these simple steps.

1. Go to the page to change.
2. Scroll to the bottom and press "Edit this page". If you have a GitHub account this will then create a fork of this repo and you can change or add
   the markdown files.
3. Once you have written all the changes, push them to the remote fork and create a pull request into the main repository.

:::info

If you either changed or added LaTex equations then please do the following to make sure it renders correctly. For this you will need to start
the development server which can be done in two ways:

1. Make sure you have node installed. Install the node dependencies with `npm install`. Start the development server using `npm run start` and navigate
   to `https://localhost:3000`.

2. Or if you have experience with Docker and Docker compose you can start the development server using the `docker compose up` command and navigate to
   `https://localhost:3000`.

:::

:::info

If you wish to add or change a PlantUML diagram then I recommend you use the [PlantUML Documentation](https://plantuml.com/), previously created diagrams
or [diagrams in the feature section](#plantuml) above as reference.

Make sure you are using my custom theme by adding the following at the beginning of a diagram:

```
@startuml
!theme purplerain from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch/main

...

@enduml
```

:::

#### MDX

If the file you want to edit ends in `.mdx` then there can and probably will be some JSX in the file so you will need to know how React and JSX works. If you do not know
then either ignore the blocks of JSX or do note edit any files ending in `.mdx` :)

#### Jupyter Notebooks

If you want to add a jupyter notebook or edit a page that was generated from then I would hope you know how to do so. However only edit the jupyter notebook not the
generated markdown file. Also make sure that you are using the correct development environment so that the jupyter notebooks are automatically converted to markdown.
