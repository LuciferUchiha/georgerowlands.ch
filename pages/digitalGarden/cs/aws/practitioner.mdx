# Cloud Practitioner

There are sample questions somewhere
Hands on is free to 12 euro (depending on service different payment schemes but everything pay as you go per use/time)
Aws console is where you actually do stuff
Make sure account is activated and choose free support plan

## What is cloud computing

Client, server via network with ip addresses. Just like postboxes.
Build up of a server: cpur, ram data and strucutred data (databases)
Network our of cables routers switch and servers incl. dns

Mainting own data center(server cluster) pay rent, power, scaling is limited, people etc. solution: cloud

Cloud criteria from cloud computing lecture: 
- on demand
- Broad network access
- Ressource sharing/pooling multi-tenancy
- Rapid elasticity and scaliblity
- Measured service pay as you go

Types of clouds:
- private (rackspace? Proxmox?)
- public aws azure, gc
- Hybrid some local some cloud.

When using a cloud u Trade capital expense capex for operational expense opex

Dont need to guess capacity, save on having to maintain a data center, high availability and fault tolerance

Types of cloud computing:

- IaaS, provide infrastructure highest level of flexibility (EC2, digital ocean)
- PaaS, dont need to manage infrastructure just run app, elastic beanstalk
- SaaS, just work no managment. Face rocgnition on aws or gmail

Show different levels the 3 + on premise of what has to be managed.

Aws has map on infrastructure.aws:
- regions
- availability zones
- data centers
- edge locations/points of presence

Regions have 3-6 zones with each 1 or more datacenters. Each zone has redudant power, network and connectivity. Availability zones are isolated from each other for disasters. And are connected with high bandwidth, low-latency network within region

A bit unclear of meaning of edge locations?



How to choose a region:
- compliance, data governance and legal requirements 
- Proximity, reduce latency
- Availiability, not all services are available in all regions
- Pricing


Search at the top is very useful as also has docs and tutorials

Some services are global and have the same view no matter which region (can be seen in the top right)

Can list services by region (link todo)

Shared responsibility diagram shows who is responsible for what (u or aws) how u configure services are ur responsibility if u configure shit security ur fault. Aws is responsible for security on software and hardware level.

## IAM - Identity and access management

I am, to remember the acronym

Is a global service. To manage accounts access. When signing up by default a root account is created and shouldnt be used or shared. Create a new user(IAM) and group(admin, policy adminaccess)rather then root. Groups only contain users. Users can belong to 0 to n groups.
Users or groups can be assigned permissions/policies via json
Use least privilege principle.
When creating a user can force them to set new password on first signup if for others.
Rather than using the provided sign in link for a user can create an alias. Whats the point only useful if using multiple accounts 

Suggest to have in one admin and in other incognito window the other account.

Inline policies are created on a single user. Otherwise users normally inhert policies via a group.
Policies have language version, identifier and statement.

Each statment has an id, effect (allow or deny), principal (to what), action (what actions are allowed or denied), ressource ( to which ressource), condition (for when it should be applied or not)

Iamreadonly, iamfullacces.

AdminstratorcAccess if you look at json just has allow * on oversthing. Can see api calls that are allowed and how is defined for each policy. * is wildcard as expected.

Directly vs inline? Is it the same?

## Ec2 - elastic compute cloud
