# Control Flow

These work just as in many other languages so will not go into further detail.

### If/Else

```c
if (test expression1) {
   // statement(s)
}
else if (test expression2) {
   // statement(s)
}
else {
   // statement(s)
}
```

### For

```c
for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement) {
    // statements inside the body of loop
}
```

### While

```c
while (testExpression) {
  // the body of the loop
}
```

### Do While

```c
do {
  // the body of the loop
}
while (testExpression);
```

### Break and Continue

The `break` statement ends a loop immediately when it is encountered. The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.

### Goto

Just dont use this.... if you need it you are doing something wrong unless you have a very very special use-case.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int num, i = 1;
    printf("Enter the number whose table you want to print?");
    scanf("%d", &num);
table:
    printf("%d x %d = %d\n", num, i, num * i);
    i++;
    if (i <= 10)
        goto table;
}
```

### Switch

Important to note here is that the values of expression and each constant-expression must have an integral type and a constant-expression must have an unambiguous constant integral value at compile time. Also the break here makes sure that it doesn't fall through to the other statements.

```c
switch (expression) {
    case constant-expression-1:
      // statements
      break;

    case constant-expression-t2:
      // statements
      break;
    default:
      // default statements
}
```
