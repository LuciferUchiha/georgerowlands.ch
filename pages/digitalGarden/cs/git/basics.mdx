# Git Basics

You can find more in depth information on git in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## Initial Setup

The first thing you should do after installing git is set your username and email.
These are stored in a `gitconfig` file. There are multiple levels of configs, `--global` being for the entire system
and `--local` only for that repository.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@example.com"
```

To check your settings you can use

```bash
git config --list
```

To get help for any command you can use

```bash
git <command> --help or git help <command>
```

## Initialize a Repository in an Existing Directory

Make sure this is executed inside the directory you want to have as a repository. This command will create a new
subdirectory named `.git` which contains all the files that are needed for maintaining your repository including but not
limited to the commit history.

*Do not delete the `.git` folder unless you know what you are doing!*

```bash
git init
```

## Making Changes to a Repository

After adding/deleting/modifying files, use `git add <directory>` or `git add <file>` to add the files to the queue to be
committed.
`git commit` commits all the added files. To be more descriptive a commit messages can also be added
with `git commit -m “<message>”` which is very important so that you know what was changed in that commit.

You can also use the following to make life easier:

- `git add -A` stages all changes
- `git add .` stages new files and modifications, without deletions
- `git add -u` stages modifications and deletions, without new files

To save even more time you can use the `git commit -a` command which is the same as executing `git add -A` followed by
a `git commit`. This can then be combined to the following

```bash
git commit -am "<message>"
```

To check the status of the files in your repository use`git status`.

To see the history of your commits you can use `git log`.

## Using a Remote Repository

For collaboration with other people or as a backup it is useful to have your local repository linked to a remote
repository, for example on a GitHub server.

It is easiest to start with a repository created on the GitHub server. Cloning this repository creates a new local
repository that is linked to the remote one you cloned. To clone a repo
use `git clone https://github.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch.git`

If you already have a local repository and want to add a remote repository you can do so the following way:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/LuciferUchiha/georgerowlands.ch.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The first command adds the remote repo as a remote with the name `origin`.
The second command changes the current branch name to `main` as this is the default branch that is created on github.
The last command pushes to the remote repo and marks at as the upstream branch for the current branch.

You can check the remote repositories you are connected to with `git remote -v`.
Now you can edit and add files and commit your changes. Once you are done, you can *push* your changes with

```bash
git push
```

Before you continue working you should pull any changed you might have committed from another computer or that might
have been committed by a collaborator

```bash
git pull
```

## Branching

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git
is `master`.
Every time you commit, the `master` branch pointer (`HEAD`)moves forward automatically.

To create a new branch use the command:

```bash
git branch testing
```

The `git branch` command only created a new branch it didn’t switch to that branch.

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitHeadToMaster.png"
    caption="The HEAD pointer is still pointing to the master branch which points to the latest commit."
    width="800"
/>

To switch to an existing branch, you run the `git checkout testing` command.

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitHeadToTesting.png"
    caption="The HEAD is now pointing to the testing branch."
    width="800"
/>

After changing a file and commiting, our structure could look something like this

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitHeadAhead.png"
    caption="The HEAD and the testing branch are now ahead of the master branch."
    width="800"
/>

To create and checkout a new branch at the same time:

```bash
git checkout -b testing
```

To view all branches use `git branch` without any parameters. By adding `-v` you can also see the last commit on each
branch. If you add `--all` you can also see the remote branches of a repository.

## Merging

Assume our structure looks like the following

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitBranching.png"
    caption="Two branches are based on the master branch and have been worked on."
    width="800"
/>

### Fast-Forward

If we now execute the commands bellow, a so-called fast-forward merge is done which basically moves the pointer of the
master branch.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge hotfix
```

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitFastForward.png"
    caption='The master hotfix branch can be merged by "fast-forwarding" the master branch pointer to the hotfix branch.'
    width="800"
/>

### Three-Way

We can now delete the hotfix branch, checkout the issue branch and do some more work.

```bash
git branch -d hotfix
git checkout iss53
echo "lots of work" > index.html
git commit -a -m "Did lots of work"
```

We now however want our new changes to also be in the master branch, so we want to merge `iss53` into `master`.

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitThreeWayStart.png"
    caption='The current structure of the branches before merging the iss53 branch into the master branch.'
    width="800"
/>

```bash
git checkout master
git merge iss53
```

A fast-forward is not possible here so git does a so called three-way merge. It is called three-way because it uses the
two branch heads and their common ancestor.

<Image 
    src="/compSci/gitThreeWayEnd.png"
    caption='The three-way merge creates a new commit that has two parents, the last commit of the master branch and the last commit of the iss53 branch.'
    width="800"
/>

### Merge Conflicts

On the rare occasion the process above doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file differently in
the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to merge them. This is a so called merge conflict. With `git status`
you can see in which files there are conflicts, they will be marked as `unmerged`.

If you open up such a file you will find something along the following:

```html filename="index.html"
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
    please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> iss53:index.html
```

To resolve the merge conflict you need to choose one of the 2 versions you want or merge the code manually. This
resolution has a little of each section, and the \<, = and \> lines have been completely removed. To finish it off use
a `git add` on the resolved file.

```html filename="index.html"
<div id="footer">
    please contact us at email.support@github.com
</div>
```
