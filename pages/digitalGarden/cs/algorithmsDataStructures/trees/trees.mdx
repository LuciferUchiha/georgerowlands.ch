# What is a Tree?

<Callout type="todo">
    Technically a tree doesn't have to be directed. But doing so makes it clear which node is the root. 
    If this is not the case we have to define the root separately making it a rooted tree.
    Forests and Monte Carlo would also be cool.
</Callout>

In Computer science a tree is a data structure that is used to represent a hierarchical structure within a set of elements.
A tree consists of node that are connected by edges. Each node has a corresponding value, the so called **key**.
This might sound familiar as it is the same as in a graph. All nodes are connected to each other by edges so there 
is a path from each node to each other node, there are no isolated nodes making it **connected**.

In fact we can say a tree is a special type of directed graph where each node apart from one, 
the so called **root**, has exactly **one parent and each node can have multiple children**. In most visualizations the 
root is at the top and the children are below it, creating the hierarchical tree like structure. For this reason 
the directions of the edges are often not drawn as it is implied that they are pointing downwards from the parent 
to the children.

Because each node only has one parent, **there is always exactly one path from one node to another node**. This is why 
trees are acyclic, meaning there are **no cycles in the tree**. If there were two different paths from one node to another
there would be a cycle in the graph and the hierarchical structure would be lost. This leads to the common 
definition of a tree as a **directed acyclic graph, short DAG**.

In trees there are a few relationships between nodes that are important to know:
- We have already seen that just like in the real world a tree always has a **root**. This 
is the node at the top of the tree and is the only node that has no parent.
- A **child** node is a node that is connected to a node above it, the so called **parent**. 
- Just like in the real world a **sibling** is a node that shares the same parent. 
- If we focus on a specific node and look at all of its children and their children and so on we get a **subtree**. 
So for a tree with 5 nodes we can have 5 subtrees, including the tree itself.
- Just like in the real world a **leaf** is a node that just hangs there with nothing below it, i.e 
a node that has no children. All other nodes that are not leaves and have at least one child are called **inner nodes**.

Apart from relationships between nodes there are also some important properties of trees that are important to know 
in addition to normal graph properties like degree, path, cycle, connectedness and so on:
- The **order of a tree** is the maximum amount of children a node can have. In the tree above we don't know the 
order of the tree but we can say that it is greater or equal to 3.
- The **height of a tree** is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. In the above tree the height is 5.
- The **depth of a node** is very similar to the height but is the length of the path from the root to that specific node. 
It is often denoted as $\text{depth}(v)=\text{Number of nodes on path to root}$. So in the above tree $\text{depth}(L)=4$.
- A **level** is a grouping of all nodes with the same depth. So the number of levels is the height of the tree.

## Full and Complete Trees

Lastly there are a few special types of trees that are important to know about:
- A **Full tree** is a tree where all inner nodes have the maximum amount of Nodes according to the order.
So a node has either 0 or the maximum amount of children. In the image below both trees are full with an order of 2.
- A **Complete tree** is a tree where each level has the maximum amount of nodes according to the order. 
So there are no gaps in the tree. A complete tree is always full but a full tree is not always complete.
In the image below only the left tree is complete with an order of 2.
