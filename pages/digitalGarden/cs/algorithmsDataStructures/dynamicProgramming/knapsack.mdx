# Knapsack Problem

The knapsack problem is a very popular problem with many different variations. The problem is as follows:

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items you should pick to maximize the value
> while keeping the overall weight smaller than the limit of your knapsack (backpack).

Some popular variations of the knapsack problem are:

- 0/1 Knapsack: You can either take an item or not take it.
- Unbounded Knapsack: You can take an item multiple times.
- Bounded Knapsack: You can take an item a limited number of times.
- Fractional Knapsack: You can take a fraction of an item.

The [subset sum problem](./subsetSum) is a variation of the knapsack problem where the weight of each item is equal to its value and
the goal is not to maximize the value but to get a specific value and weight. In my definition of the subset sum problem I allowed
an item to be used multiple times, so it is a variation of the unbounded knapsack problem.

    Actually implement the knapsack problem with the different variations.
