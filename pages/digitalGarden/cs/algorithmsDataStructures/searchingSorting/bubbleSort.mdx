# Bubble Sort

| Situation | Comparisons | Swaps | Total Time Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-----------------------|
| Worst     | $O(n^2)$ | $O(n^2)$ | $O(n^2)$ |
| Best      | $\Omega(n)$ | $\Omega(1)$ | $\Omega(n)$ |
| Tight     | - | - | - |

With the [binary search algorithm](/digitalGarden/cs/algorithmsDataStructures/searchingSorting/binarySearch) we have 
seen that we can search for an element quicker than with a linear search if the collection is sorted. But how do we sort 
a collection in the first place? This is where sorting algorithms come in.

Let's first discuss what it formally means to sort a collection. A collection of $n$ elements is sorted if the following 
holds:

> Given a collection $A$ of $n$ elements, $A[0], A[1], \ldots, A[n-1]$, the sorting algorithm finds a permutation/reordering 
> of the elements such that $A[0] \leq A[1] \leq \ldots \leq A[n-1]$ (for ascending order).

There are many different sorting algorithms, but let's start by developing an algorithm that simply checks if the given 
collection is sorted. This algorithm simply goes through the array of integers and checks if the current element is less 
than or equal to the next element. 

```java
public boolean isSorted(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

From this algorithm we can develop our first sorting algorithm, the Bubble Sort algorithm. The idea is that it goes 
through the array and if the current element is greater than the next element, it swaps them, trying to correct the 
order of the elements.

```java
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
            // if the elements are in the wrong order
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // swap elements
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The algorithm is called Bubble Sort because when visualizing the algorithm it looks as if with each iteration the element 
in the array "bubbles" up to its correct position.

## Correctness

To prove the correctness of the Bubble Sort we can use induction with an invariant. we can define the following invariant: 

$$
\text{Invariant(i)}: \text{After the $i$th iteration, the $i$ largest elements are in the correct position.}
$$

<Callout type="proof">
We want to prove that the invariant holds for all $i$ and therefore also for $n$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.

1. **Base Case**: After the first iteration, the largest element is in the correct position. This is because the largest 
element will always be swapped and end up at the end of the array.
2. **Induction hypothesis**: We assume that the invariant holds for some $i$.
3. **Inductive step**: We want to show that the invariant holds for $i+1$. After $i$ iterations, the $i$ largest elements 
are in the correct position, i.e at the end of the array. In the $i+1$ iteration, the $i+1$ largest element will be swapped 
until it is next to the $i$ largest element. This means that after the $i+1$ iteration, the $i+1$ largest elements are 
in the correct position.

Therefore, the invariant holds for all $i$ and the array is sorted after $n$ iterations, showing that the Bubble Sort 
algorithm is correct.

## Time Complexity

To analyze the time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm, we can count the number of comparisons and swaps that are 
made. 

First we start with the number of comparisons. The outer loop runs $n$ times and the inner loop runs $n-1$ times. 
This means that the total number of comparisons is $n (n-1) = n^2 - n$. Meaning that the number of comparisons is 
in $O(n^2)$. Because The number of comparisons in the above implementation is always the same no matter the content of the array, so the best 
and worst case of the number of comparisons is the same, we can more accurately say that the number of comparisons is 
in $\Theta(n^2)$.

The number of swaps depends on the content of the array. If the array is already sorted, no swaps are needed. If the 
array is sorted in reverse order, we have the worst case scenario where we have to swap every time. The number of swaps 
is therefore in $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(1)$.

The above implementation can also be slightly improved by considering the fact that after each iteration the largest element 
is guaranteed to be in the correct position. This means that we can reduce the number of elements we need to check in the 
inner loop by one each time. Making the for loops look like this:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
        // same code as before
    }
}
```

However, asymptotically this changes nothing. The number of comparisons is then: 

$$
(n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + 1
$$ 

which can be simplified using the gaussian sum to:

$$
(n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(n^2 - n)
$$

which is still in $\Theta(n^2)$, although the constant factor is halved.

We can also optimize the number of comparisons for the best case scenario by adding a flag to check if any swaps were made. 
If no swaps were made in an iteration, the array is already sorted, and we can break out of the outer loop. Resulting 
in the best case number of comparisons being in $\Omega(n)$. Meaning that bubble sort is actually not in $\Theta(n^2)$.

```java
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        boolean swapped = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        if (!swapped) {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
