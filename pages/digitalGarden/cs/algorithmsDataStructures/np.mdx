# What is NP-Hard?

Lots of Euler diagrams and examples needed. Clear formulations seem to be hard to find.

## Polynomial vs Exponential Time

## Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Algorithms

example of deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms

leaving a blank part

## P and NP

What is the stuff with the verification in polynomial time? Is mentioned but unsure how exactly need and example

## NP-Complete and NP-Hard

NP Complete is NP-Hard but als has an algo in NP?

But solving one NP-Complete problem in polynomial time means all NP-Complete problems can be solved in polynomial time???
Same goes for if one NP-Hard problem can be solved in polynomial time then all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time?

### Reduction

The conversion of one problem to another has to be in polynomial time???

### Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)

CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) ??? and then reduce to 0/1 Knapsack Problem

### Cook-Levin Theorem

Got prize for proving what it means if P = NP???

## BQP

Quantum stuff
