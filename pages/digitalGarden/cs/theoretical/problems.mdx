# Computational Problems

## Algorithms and Programs

what are they? a homomorphism from one set of all words in an alphabet to another set of all words in an alphabet.

### Ã„quivalent Algorithms

if they have the same input alphabet and all outputs are the same.

### Enumeration Algorithms

for all intergers n it outputs the sequence of the alphabet from 1 to n.

## Decision Problems

Is a word in a language. For example, is a number prime?

if the word is in the language, the answer is yes, otherwise no.

If there is such an algorithm we call it recursive???

lots of examples such as primtest, hamiltonian cycle, etc.

## Function Problems

In german relationsproblem? 

## Optimization Problems

takes 6 parameters, minimize or maximize

like TSP, max-sat, max-clique, ILP etc.

### Subproblems

## Search Problems

## Counting Problems
