# Regular Expressions & Languages

## Regular Expressions

use cases

can also easily create epsilon-NFAs therefore also DFAs and regular languages
Follow certain building rules/components such as how to handle multiplication of two regular expressions in the states, star and alternative operations.

can also go the other way around and create regular expressions from DFAs, NFAs and epislon-NFAs.

### Syntax

Reguläre Ausdrücke sind “Wörter” über dem Alphabet alphabet union mit den Operatoren `+`, `*`, `.` und `()` etc

#### Order of Precedence

### Semantik

Regular expressions seen as languages

## Regular Languages

Operations on regular languages (union, concatenation, Kleene star) 
They equal a regular language

A DFA is a regular language therefore a regular expression same things

## Pumping Lemma

ardensche lemma? used to create a regular expression from a DFA? by getting the regular expression we also get the regular language.

works a bit like solving equations till in the end we have a regular expression ie the regular language.

I think ardensche lemma is used for the above and pumping lemma is used to show that a language is not regular.

## Myhill-Nerode Theorem

Minimimum size of a DFA for a language

## Non-regular Languages
