# Deterministic Finite Automaton

Meaning of the terms deterministic and finite in the context of automata theory.

deterministic - no choice, only one path to follow
finite - finite number of states

What do they do? solve decision problems. Do this in realtime and with a fixed amount of memory no variables.

## Notation

States, transitions, and final states also called configurations and impulses? accepted or rejected states.

Difference of configuration and state?

As a graph 

## Formal Definition

Formal definition of a DFA

as a table

## Configurations

Current state of the DFA and the remaining input

Start and end configurations.

## Transition Functions

transition notation looks funny, can also somehow denote that there is a transition from one state to another without 
a direct connection.

## Language of a DFA

Language of a DFA

Can define regular languages with DFAs

## Classes

States can be grouped somehow? this can then also be used in the design.

Using this and its properties can also define accepting regular language?

## Designing a DFA

in the book he uses the classes?

### Garbage State

## Modular Design

From the slides?
