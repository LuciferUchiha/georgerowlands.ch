# Computer Systems

This Page is meant as a brief introduction to the types of computer systems there are and how they are made and the issues we have faced with making improvements to our computer systems over the years.

## Types of Computer Systems

Let us first answer the question of what is a computer. What is the difference between a computer and just any other machine. A Computer is a programmable machine. Meaning that it can change its behavior and functionality, unlike other simple machines.

Most commonly Computers are split up into the following types:

- Personal Computer, short PC. The PC is the type of computer most people use and think of when talking about a computer. It serves a very general purpose and offers a wide variety of software to solve problems in our day-to-day life. In more recent years this type has also seen the addition of personal mobile devices (PMD) or more commonly known as smartphones and tablets. These devices are meant for the average consumer which makes subjects them to cost/performance tradeoffs.
- Server computers or also just servers are computers that are usually accessed only over a network (Internet or LAN). Servers are built from the same basic technology as personal computers but with more performance and storage capabilities. Since they are also used by multiple people and are used to communicate between different applications and/or networks they have to be reliable to mitigate downtime.
- Supercomputers, these computers represent the peak of what can be done with computers and are mainly used for research and academic purposes. You can find out more about the top supercomputers [here](https://www.top500.org/).
- Embedded computers are the most used computers but people would never think so as they are usually hidden. They have a very wide range of applications and performances for example being part of your car to optimize fuel efficiency down to controlling the temperature in your coffee machine.

## How are Chips made

blbabla silicon and moores law. yield etc.

## The Power Wall

As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant. power wall and denard scaling
cant reduce voltage because of noise => bits getting flipped and cant cool

lead to hift to Multicore Processors

blabla amhdals law, cant infinetly speeedup there is some limit.

## Programming a Computer

blabla high level, compiler assembler instruciton sets
