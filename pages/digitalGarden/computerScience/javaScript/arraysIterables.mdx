# Arrays and Iterables

## Arrays
Arrays exist in JavaScript just as they do in most other programming languages, however I would describe them to be more like ArrayLists in Java as they don't have a fixed length. The precise details of how arrays are implemented are a bit more complex and depend on the EcmaScript implementation, for further details on how arrays work under the hood in JavaScript I can recommend reading [this article](https://ryanpeden.com/how-do-javascript-arrays-work-under-the-hood/).

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = []; // this would not work because const
cars[0] = "Mini"; // this however would work

cars.push("Saab") // push to the end, array is now longer
console.log(cars.length)
cars.pop() // removes the last element

const person = ["John", "Doe", 46]; // can have values of different types

const numbers = new Array(1,2,3,4,5) // you can create an array like this as well, using literal is however preferred
numbers[20] = 21 // has made the array sparase, indexes 4-19 now have the value undefined
```

### Checking for an Array

Checking if a variable holds an array is not as easy as one would expect because the `typeof` operator returns "object". Instead we have a few solutions:

1. Use the static method `Array.isArray()`.
2. Use the `instanceof` operator.

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
console.log(typeof cars); // object
console.log(Array.isArray(cars)); // true
console.log(cars instanceof Array); // true
```

## Spread Operator

The spread operator `...` allows you to pull elements out of an array (=> split the array into a list of its elements) or pull the properties out of an object. The spread operator copies data safely (i.e. preventing future mutation of the copied original).

```jsx
const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...oldArray, 4, 5]; // This now is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oldObject = {
  name: "Max"
};
const newObject = {
  ...oldObject,
  age: 28
};
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to easily access and copy (not reference) the values of arrays or objects and assign them to variables.

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, b] = array;
console.log(a); // prints 1
console.log(b); // prints 2
const myObj = {
  name: "Max",
  age: 28
}
const {name} = myObj;
console.log(name); // prints "Max"
console.log(age); // prints undefined
console.log(myObj); // prints {name: "Max", age: 28}
```
