# ES6

## let and const

These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript. Before ES6, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope.

Variables declared with the `let` keyword can have Block Scope. However variables declared inside a block can not be accessed from outside the block.

```jsx
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
{
  let y = 2;
}
// y can NOT be used here
```

Declaring a variable with `const` is similar to `let` when it comes to Block Scope. JavaScript `const` variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. However, The keyword `const` is a little misleading. You can't change constant primitive values, but you can change the properties of a constant objects.

```jsx
// You can create a const object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
// You can change a property:
car.color = "red";
// You can add a property:
car.owner = "Johnson";
// You CAN'T reassign a constant object:
car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR
```

## Arrow functions

Arrow functions are a different way of creating functions in JavaScript. Besides a shorter syntax, they offer advantages when it comes to keeping the scope of the `this` keyword.

```jsx
function callMe(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
// Or
const callMe = function(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
// Becomes
const callMe = (name) => {
  console.log(name);
}
```

## Exports and imports

In JavaScript projects you split your code across multiple JavaScript files, so called modules. You do this, to keep each file/module focused and manageable. To still access functionality in another file, you need export (to make it available) and import (to get access) statements.
You got two different types of exports: default (unnamed) and named exports:
**Default** => `export default ...;`
**Named** => `export const someData = ...;`
You can import default exports like this:

```jsx
import someNameOfYourChoice from "./path/to/file.js";
```

Named exports have to be imported by their name:

```jsx
import { someData } from "./path/to/file.js";
```

A file can only contain one default and an unlimited amount of named exports. You can also mix the one default with any amount of named exports in one and the same file. When importing named exports, you can also import all named exports at once with the following syntax:

```jsx
import * as upToYou from "./path/to/file.js";
```

This simply bundles all exported variables/functions in one JavaScript object. You can access like this: `upToYou.someData`

## Classes

Classes allow you to define blueprints for JavaScript objects. With classes you can also add inheritance to JavaScript objects.

```jsx
class Human {
  species = "human";
}
class Person extends Human {
  name = "Max";
  printMyName = () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
const person = new Person();
person.printMyName(); // prints "Max"
console.log(person.species); // prints "human"
```

## Spread Operator

The spread operator `...` allows you to pull elements out of an array (=> split the array into a list of its elements) or pull the properties out of an object. The spread operator copies data safely (i.e. preventing future mutation of the copied original).

```jsx
const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...oldArray, 4, 5]; // This now is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oldObject = {
  name: "Max"
};
const newObject = {
  ...oldObject,
  age: 28
};
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to easily access and copy (not reference) the values of arrays or objects and assign them to variables.

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, b] = array;
console.log(a); // prints 1
console.log(b); // prints 2
const myObj = {
  name: "Max",
  age: 28
}
const {name} = myObj;
console.log(name); // prints "Max"
console.log(age); // prints undefined
console.log(myObj); // prints {name: "Max", age: 28}
```
