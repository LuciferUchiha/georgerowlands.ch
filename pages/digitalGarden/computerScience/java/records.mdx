# Records

With JDK 14 [record classes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/language/records.html) were introduced, which are
a new kind of type declaration. They are especially useful for passing around immutable data containers. For example
consider the immutable class below.

```java filename="Rectangle.java"
public final class Rectangle {
    private final double length;
    private final double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    // getters
    double length() {
        return this.length;
    }

    double width() {
        return this.width;
    }

    // Implementation of equals() and hashCode(), which specify
    // that two record objects are equal if they
    // are of the same type and contain equal field values.
    public boolean equals(Object other) {...}

    public int hashCode() {...}

    // An implementation of toString() that returns a string
    // representation of all the record class's fields,
    // including their names.
    public String toString() {...}
}
```

The following record is equivalent to the above.

```java filename="Rectangle.java"
record Rectangle(double length, double width) {}
```

A record consists of a name and a list of components (length and width). A record automatically provides the following
functionalities:

- A private final field for each of its components.
- A public read accessor (Getter) method for each component with the same name and type of the component (without get,
  so length() not getLength()).
- A public canonical constructor which initializes all components.
- Implementations of the equals() and hashCode() methods, which specify that two records are equal if they are of the
  same type and their components are equal.
- An implementation of the toString() method that includes the string representation of all the record's components,
  with their names. For example "rectangle[length=12, width=10]".

There are however some restrictions when working with records:

- Records cannot extend any class (because they already extend the Record class just like enums extend the Enum class).
- Records cannot declare instance fields (apart from the private final fields in the component list).
- Records cannot extend other records and therefore also can't be abstract because they are implicitly final.
- The components of a record are implicitly final, they can not be made mutable.

There are however some things you can still do:

- You can declare a record inside a class however a nested record will be implicitly static.
- You can create generic records
- Records can implement interfaces
- You can declare in a record's body static methods, static fields, static initializers, constructors, instance methods,
  and nested types
- You can annotate records and a record's individual components

## Canonical and compact constructors

Records automatically generate a canonical constructor which initializes all components. You can however also define the
canonical constructor yourself for example if you want to add validation.

```java filename="Rectangle.java"
record Rectangle(double length, double width) {
    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
            throw new java.lang.IllegalArgumentException(String.format("Invalid dimensions: %f, %f", length, width));
        }
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }
}
```

Having to rewrite the component list as parameters for the constructors can be tiresome and also very error-prone which
is why compact constructors which were introduced whose signature is derived from the component list. At the end the
compact constructor also assigns parameters to the corresponding private fields.

```java filename="Rectangle.java"
record Rectangle(double length, double width) {
    public Rectangle {
        if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
            throw new java.lang.IllegalArgumentException(String.format("Invalid dimensions: %f, %f", length, width));
        }
    }
}
```
