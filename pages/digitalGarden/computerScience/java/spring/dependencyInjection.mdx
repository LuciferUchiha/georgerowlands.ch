# Dependency Injection and Beans

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in software development and is especially used in the Spring framework.
Dependency Injection allows objects to be created with their dependencies explicitly provided, instead of the objects
themselves having to be responsible for the creation of their dependencies. It is a way to achieve loose coupling
between objects and their dependencies. This is also referred to as Inversion of Control, IoC which is another principle
where instead of as in traditional programming, a component would create and control the objects it depends on in IoC the
responsibility is shifted to a container or framework, in Springs case the Spring Container.

When working with Spring Dependency Injection is controlled by the Spring Container which is responsible for creating
and managing the lifecycle of objects, and injecting their dependencies. The objects are referred to as beans. These
beans are then kept track of in the Spring/Application Context which can be fetched as follows:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
      for (String beanName : context.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
         System.out.println(beanName);
      }
   }
}
```

For the Spring Container to know what is a bean you use to define them using XML but nowadays, you just annotate Java
Classes. The parent annotation is `@Bean`, however most of the time you will be using different ones such as `@Entity`,
`@Component`, `@Controller`, `@Service` which all inherit from it. Once the bean is defined, the container reads manages
it and can inject it into its dependencies. Dependency injection is also commonly referred to as auto-wiring
relationships between beans, which is why in Spring you use the annotation `@Autowired` for a dependency to be injected.

Beans are found and created most via a component scan. Packages are scanned for annotated classes. Scan is started in
package of main class and then down the tree so make sure no beans above main package! can also override basePackage to
start the scan.

```java
@Component("fooFormatter")
public class FooFormatter {
    public String format() {
        return "foo";
    }
}
```

We can then inject the dependency in many ways such as Constructor injection, Setter injection or Field injection.
Constructor being the best practice and the other being heavily debated:

```java
@Component
public class FooServiceField {
    @Autowired
    private FooFormatter fooFormatter;
}
@Component
public class FooServiceSetter {
    private FooFormatter fooFormatter;
    @Autowired
    public void setFormatter(FooFormatter fooFormatter) {
        this.fooFormatter = fooFormatter;
    }
}
@Component
public class FooServiceConstructor {
    private FooFormatter fooFormatter;
    @Autowired // optional
    public FooServiceConstructor(FooFormatter fooFormatter) {
        this.fooFormatter = fooFormatter;
    }
}
```

## Qualifiers and Primary Beans

use qualifiers so that when interface is to be injected we can choose implementation. Or mark one as primary, i.e the
default one to inject. Show example of in constructor

## Spring Profiles

Can setup different profiles for example in dev you want h2 database and matching services etc. and then for in prod use
postgres or mysql. Or could also use for different languages, why would an api be language dependent? 2 beans with same
name but then set different profiles and in application.properties set the active profile. there is a default profile and
you can have multiple profiles.

## Spring Bean Lifecycle

all beans are made ready before application is considered ready for use. Can hook onto certain events to do certain thigns.
Rarely need to do anything with this stuff. PreDestroy annotated method much more lightly to use.

## Spring Stereotype

@Component, Controller etc. A certain set of characteristics expected with a bean. Not always functional could also just
be for readability/documentation. thia ahould prob be mentioned somewhere above.

## Bean Scopes

default is singelton, one isntance in the spring container. Other possibilites are prototype where new instance for each
request and then more neach scopes such as request, session , global session, application??? and websocket. Could also
make custom scope why idk. Set using scope annotation, almsot always singelton is fine.
