# Inheritance

Works very similar to other programming languages like Java where you have super/parent classes and sub/child classes and the child inherits the attributes and functions of the parent.

In C++ the above relationship would be implemented like this:

```cpp
class Person {
    string m_name;
    int m_age;
public:
    Person(const string& name, int age) : m_name(name), m_age(age) {}
    virtual string getName() const { return m_name; } // virtual could be overwritten
    void setName(const string& name) { m_name = name; }
    int getAge() { return m_age; }
    void setAge(int age) { m_age = age; }
    void print() const {
        cout << "Name: " << m_name << endl;
        cout << "Alter: " << m_age << endl;
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
    int m_number;
public:
    Student(const string& name, int age, int nr) : Person(name, age), m_number(nr) {} // call super constructor
    int getNumber() { return m_number; }
    void setNumber(int nr) { m_number = nr; }
    void printNumber() const {
        cout << "Matrikelnummer: " << m_number << endl;
    }
};
```

```cpp
void main() {
    Person pers("Peter", 20);
    pers.setAge(21);
    pers.print();

    Student student("Anna", 21, 50101);
    student.setName("Anne");
    student.setNumber(56123);
    student.print();
    student.printNumber();

    Person pers2 = student; // projects/copies student onto person
    pers2.print();
    // pers2.printNumber(); // not defined
}
```

As one would expect you need to call the parent constructor in the initializer list of the child (if this is not done the default constructor will be called). Then you can further delegate to other constructors in the child and make sure all attributes are initialized.

## Inheriting Constructors

There is a special way to use the `using` keyword to inherit and be able to refer to the constructors of a parent. If in the example below `using` is not used then the default constructor would be called and m_val would not be initialized.

```c
class A
{
    int m_val;
    public:
        A(int x) : m_val(x) {}
};

class B: public A
{
     using A::A;
};
```

## Destructors

The destructor of a child calls the destructor of its parent after completion. This is so that dynamically allocated attributes can be removed first. Destructors should also in most cases only be implemented if there are dynamically allocated attributes that need to be cleaned up.

Important is that the destructor will also be called at the end of the block in which a static object was used.

## Overload Resolution with Inheritance

A common scenario is that a child overloads a parent's function. When doing so we can however run into problems for example if he have the following functions:

```cpp
void Person::foo(char c);
void Student::foo(int i);
```

and then want to do the following:

```cpp
Student s;
s.foo(10); // Student::foo(int i) is called
s.foo('A'); // Student::foo(int i) is called
```

We cant see that in both cases the Student implementation gets used. This is because the compiler looks first in the child if there is a function that matches the call, and there is because the char can get implicitly casted to an int (only after it has checked all functions in the child will it scan the parent). But what if we want the char implementation of the parent to be used. There are two ways:

- The child offers the parents function by writing `using Person::foo;`.
- The parent function is explicitly called `s.Person::foo('A');`.

## Casting and RTTI

### Converting Pointers

The type of a reference or pointer variable does not have to be the same type as the object to which the variable points.

```cpp
// Till now
Student stud("Anna", 21, 50101);
Person pers = stud;
// But also
Student* stud2 = new Student("Bob", 20, 50111);
Person* pers2 = new Student("Anna", 21, 50101);
pers2->print();
Person* pers3 = stud2; // implicit up-cast
pers3->print();
Student* stud3 = static_cast<Student*>(pers2);
stud3->printNumber();
// Student* stud4 = dynamic_cast<Student*>(pers2); does not work
```

Important here to see is that when up-casting and the down-casting back to the original type the data is not lost. Just the type of the reference/pointer variable changes.

#### Converting Smart Pointers

You can also convert smart pointers which also follow the same rules as normal pointers.

```cpp
    shared_ptr<Person> spPers = make_shared<Person>("Bob", 21);
    shared_ptr<Person> spStud = make_shared<Student>("Anna", 20, 50010);
    auto sp1 = static_pointer_cast<Student>(spStud);
    auto sp2 = dynamic_pointer_cast<Student>(spStud);
    auto sp3 = dynamic_pointer_cast<Student>(spPers); // sp3==nullptr
```

### RTTI - Runtime Type Information

The problem however is that when you illegally downcast like below then you get a runtime exception (or even nothing) which you want to avoid.

```cpp
Person* pers = new Person("Anna", 21);
Student* stud = (Student*)pers;
Student* stud2 = static_cast<Student*>(pers);
stud->printNumber();
stud2->printNumber();
```

To prevent this there is the RTTI system that stores the exact type of each instance. The system can be turned on and off as you wish. The dynamic_cast is based on this and works as expected on a valid down-cast. But if the down-cast is illegal it returns a nullptr instead of causing a runtime error.

```cpp
Person* pers = new Person("Anna", 21);
Student* stud = dynamic_cast<Student*>(pers);
cout << boolalpha << (stud == nullptr) << endl; // true
```

You can also read the type information that the RTTI system stores by using the `typeid` operator which is very similar to `instanceof` in Java.

```cpp
Person* pers = new Person("Bob", 21);
Person* stud = new Student("Anna", 20, 50010);
const type_info& typePers = typeid(*pers);
const type_info& typeStud = typeid(*stud);
cout << boolalpha << (typePers == typeStud) << endl; // false
cout << "Is Person a parent of Student: "<< boolalpha << typePers.before(typeStud) << endl; // true
```

## Overriding and Shadowing

Children can have functions with the same signature as a function in the parent, this in turn overrides the function in the parent with the version in the child (overriding).
You can also define attributes in a child that have the same name as attributes in the parent. This is called shadowing and should be avoided at all costs. If this does happen then you must explicitly define when you want to use the shadowed attribute in the parent `Person::x` or `static_cast<Person*>(this)->x`.

### Binding

Binding is the act of assigning a function body to a function call. This can be done in two ways:

- Static (early) binding happens at compile time and allows the compiler to replace the function calls with the function bodies. This is the default behavior.
- Dynamic (late) binding happens at runtime. For this to work the `virtual` keyword must be used.

So to override a parent's function in a child you must explicitly define a function as virtual meaning it can be overridden. Then when overriding you must explicitly say that you want to override a function. If a function is virtual then all of the overridden functions are also implicitly virtual.

```cpp
class Person {
    virtual void print() const {
        cout << "Some printing" << endl;
    }
};
class Student : public Person {
    void print() const override {
        Person::print(); // Call parent print()
        cout << "Some more printing" << endl;
    }
};
```

### Blocking Overriding or Inheritance

You can block methods from being overridden, this is just simply done by adding the `final` modifier. This can also be used for class definitions to stop classes from being inherited. The final modifier can however only be added to virtual functions. This is done because non-virtual functions are automatically final.

```cpp
class A { virtual void foo(int i); };
class B final : A { void foo(int i) final override {}; };
class C : B { void foo(int i) override {}; }; // does not work
```

## Access specifiers

## Automatically Created Functions

By default when creating a class the system provides a default constructor, destructor and assignment operator which are all non-virtual. For this reason, destructors and assignment operators should be defined as virtual so that they can be overridden in the children.

```cpp
virtual ~Vehicle() = default;
virtual Vehicle& operator=(const Vehicle& v) = default;
```

## Interfaces

In C++ there is no such thing as the `interface` type. There also isn't the `abstract` modifier. Instead, an abstract class without any implementations is the same as an interface. An abstract can't be instantiated and for a class to be abstract there must be at least one abstract function. An abstract function is a virtual function with no implementation.

```cpp
struct IVehicle{
    virtual ~IVehicle() = default;
    virtual void drive() = 0; // abstract (pure virtual)
};
class Bicycle: public IVehicle {
public:
    void drive() override { cout << "broom" << endl; }// Implements the abstract function
};
int main() {
    IVehicle* v = new Bicycle();
    delete v;// calls Bicycle destructor because virtual
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance

In C++ a class can inherit from more than one class. The constructors of inherited classes are called in the same order in which they are inherited. The destructors are called in reverse order of constructors. So in the program below B’s constructor is called before A’s constructor.

```cpp
class A {
public:
  A()  { cout << "A's constructor called" << endl; }
};

class B {
public:
  B()  { cout << "B's constructor called" << endl; }
};

class C: public B, public A {
public:
  C()  { cout << "C's constructor called" << endl; }
};
```

As you might imagine this can cause a few problems. Suppose two parent classes have the same function which is not overridden in the child class. If you then try to call the function using from the child class the compiler will show an error because it doesn't know which function to call.

```cpp
class A {
  public:
      void someFunction() { cout << "A" << endl; }
};
class B {
    void someFunction() { cout << "B" << endl; }
};
class C : public A, public B {};

int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.someFunction(); // error
    // to solve it:
    obj.A::someFunction();
    obj.B::someFunction();
}
```

### Diamond Problem

There is however also the so-called diamond problem which is when we have a commonly seen structure as below:

![diamondProblem](/compSci/diamondProblem.png)

We then run into problems if we want to do something like this:

```cpp
Rechteck r(0, 0, 20, 50);
RechteckMitText br(10, 5, 60, 60, "Text");
r.zeichnen(); // Rechteck::zeichnen()
br.zeichnen()// RechteckMitText::zeichnen()
Position rPos = r.getPos(); // works fine
Position brPos = br.getPos(); // Error
GraphObj*pObj = &br; // Error
```

Because the compiler does not know which getPos to call and the partial class `GraphObj` is inherited twice. To resolve this we can use virtual inheritance which ensures that only one copy of a parent's member variable is inherited.

```cpp
class Rechteck : virtual public GraphObj {...};
class ObjMitText: virtual public GraphObj {...};
class RechteckMitText: public ObjMitText, public Rechteck {
public:
    RechteckMitText(int x, int y, int w, int h, string text)
        : ObjMitText(-2, -2, text), Rechteck(-1, -1, w, h), GraphObj(x, y) {}
};
```
