Simply put Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. Makefiles are most
commonly used with big C/C++ programs as other programming languages have their own build tools that are very similar to
Makefiles (Java has Gradle or Maven). Makefiles don't necessarily need to be used for compiling programs as they just
define a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed. The focus of this page will however be on
how Makefiles are used to compile C/C++ programs.

## Running a Makefile

To use Makefiles you need to have `make` installed. To check whether you have installed it use the
command `make --help`.

The series of instructions for a Makefile or written in a file called `Makefile` (no file ending) hence the name
Makefiles. On Unix based systems this is easily created with the `touch Makefile` command.

Just like all programming languages, there is a hello world example for Makefiles as well.

```makefile filename="Makefile"
hello:
    echo "Hello, World"
```

To run the example you just need to use the `make` command in the same folder as the Makefile.

```bash
foo@bar:~$ make
echo "Hello, World"
Hello, World
```

## Syntax

Now that we have seen a simple example let's go through how Makefiles are structured and what they exactly do.

A Makefile contains a set of **rules**. And a rule looks like this:

```makefile filename="Makefile"
targets: dependencies
    command
    command
    command
```

- The **targets** are filenames, typically there is only one per rule but there can be multiple separated by spaces.
- The **commands** are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character,
not spaces (be careful how your editor handles tabs).
- The **prerequisites** or also more commonly called **dependencies** are also filenames that are separated by spaces.
These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run.

Now that we know a bit more let's go back to the hello world example:

```makefile filename="Makefile"
hello:
    echo "Hello, World"
```

We have the target `hello`, that in turn has no dependencies. This means that in theory, the goal of this rule would be
to create a file called `hello` and to do this the `echo "Hello, World"`. Because it is the first and only rule in the
Makefile we can just run `make`, but we can also specify which target we want to build by passing it to the make
command `make hello` would in this case be equivalent. Because this Makefile never actually creates the target we can
run the command over and over again.

As mentioned before Makefiles are typically used for C/C++ programs so let's look at such an example:

```c filename="main.c"
#include "stdio.h"

int main(void){
    printf("I am a C program");
    return 0;
}
```

```makefile filename="Makefile"
main:
    gcc main.c -o main
```

Now after executing the `make` command we are actually creating the target as intended. But if we try and run the `make`
command again it will say that the target is already up to date. This is because the main file has already been created.

```bash
foo@bar:~$ make
gcc main.c -o main
foo@bar:~$ make
make: `main' is up to date.
```

Some people that are spoilt from their IDEs might now expect that if we change `main.c` and run the Makefile again that
it will get recompiled, this however is not the case. This is what the dependencies are for.

```makefile filename="Makefile"
main: main.c
    gcc main.c -o main
```

If you add `main.c` as a dependency and execute the `make` command again, it will check if any of the dependencies have
changed since last building the target. More technically explained it will check all the modification timestamps of the
dependency files and compare them to the timestamp of the target. If the target is older than one of the modification
timestamps it will rebuild the target.
