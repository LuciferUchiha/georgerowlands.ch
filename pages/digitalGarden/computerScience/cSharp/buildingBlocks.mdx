# Building Blocks of C#

## .NET

The key component is the CLR (Common Language Runtime) which contains Exception Handling, Garbage Collection, and compilers that converts the code to CIL (Common Intermediate Language)+metadata which is then used to compile JIT (Just in time), prior to execution to native machine code which makes it cross-platform. .NET emphasizes language interoperability (using multiple Languages like C++ and C# together) and platform independence.

The .Net Framework also includes a set of standard Libraries.

All the codes that is controlled by the CLR is called managed code, while the parts of the program which are written using the `unsafe` keyword are called unmanaged code. These are beyond the control of the CLR.

### Assemblies

Assemblies form the fundamental units of deployment, version control, reuse. Assemblies take the form of executable (_.exe_) or dynamic link library (_.dll_) files, and are the building blocks of .NET applications. They contain a Manifest(assembly name, version number list of modules/types), metadata(dynamic loading versioning, reflection) and the CIL Code of each Class.

### Namespaces

Namespaces allow for the logical grouping of related types, like packages in Java.
And  `using` is like import in Java. A file can declare multiple namespaces. Namespaces and classes are not mapped to directories and files (but recommended).
