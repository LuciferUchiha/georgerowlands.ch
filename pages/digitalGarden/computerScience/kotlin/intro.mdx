# Java to Kotlin Intro

## `println`

In Java the `java.lang` package is implicitly imported which contains amongst other things the classes for String, Integer
and important in this section the System class which is used to output things to the standard output via
`System.out.println()`. In Kotlin `java.lang` is implicitly imported but so is the `kotlin` package and more importantly
for this section the `kotlin.io` package (plus a few other packages). The `kotlin.io` package contains, as with a lot of
things in Kotlin the wrapper function `println()` which internally just calls `System.out.println()`. This then allows you
to not always have to write such verbose code.

        ```kotlin filename="Kotlin"
        println("hello world!")
        ```

    <Block>
        ```java filename="Java"
        System.out.println("hello world!");
        ```

## `val` and `var`

Type inference was introduced in Java 10 with the introduction of the `var` keyword. In Kotlin, you use `var` to define a
mutable variable. By default, the type can be inferred, but it can also be explicitly defined after `:`. In Kotlin, you can
also use the `val` keyword which the same as writing `final var` in Java, i.e. the variable is then immutable.

<Callout type="warning">
    The final keyword exists in Kotlin, however can not be used in conjunction with variables, only to stop inheritance
    of
    a class method. I know very confusing.

            var a = 1
            var b // doesn't work, how much memory???
            var c : Int;
            c = 4
            var d : Int = 5
            val e = 10
            e = 15 // will fail
        ```
    </Block>
    <Block>
        ```java filename="Java"
        var a = 1; // java also has type inference
        var b; // also doesn't work
        int c;
        c = 4;
        int d = 5;
        final int e = 10;
        e = 15; // will also fail
