# Time Measuring

In programs we care about two types of time:

- Real-time or also known as calendar time is a fixed time from the calendar and is used for timestamps etc.
- Process time is the amount of time a process takes which is used for measuring performance etc.

## Calendar Time

Calendar time is always in UTC(Coordinated Universal Time)/GMT(Greenwich Mean Time) no matter in which timezone the program is run. In C and most other programming languages, time is handled internally as a signed integer which is based on [Unix/epoche/POSIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The value 0 is 01.01.1970 00:00, also commonly referred to as the birth time of Unix. The integer value of time is then the number of seconds before or after this time. So if the time integer value is 60 then it corresponds to 01.01.1970 00:01.

The function `time_t time(time_t *tloc);` returns the time as the number of seconds since Unix time. If tloc is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in tloc.

### Getting and Setting System Time

With the following functions you can get and set the time as well as a timezone of the program:

- `int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tv, struct timezone *restrict tz);`
- `int settimeofday(const struct timeval *tv, const struct timezone *tz);`

With the corresponding structs:

```c
struct timeval {
    time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
    suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
};
struct timezone {
    int tz_minuteswest;     /* minutes west of Greenwich */
    int tz_dsttime;         /* type of DST correction */
};
```

However, the timezone structure is obsolete and should therefore normally be specified as NULL.

### Locale

Locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, region and how numbers, dates and times etc. should be represented. You can set the program's locale with the `char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);`. The category could be `LC_ALL`, `LC_TIME`, `LC_NUMERIC` amongst others. If you pass LC_ALL and NULL you can read the current locale.

Some possible locales could be: en_US, de_DE, de_CH etc.

### Broken-Down Time

Calendar time represents absolute time as elapsed time since the epoch. This is convenient for computation but has no relation to the way people normally think of calendar time. By contrast, broken-down time is a binary representation of calendar time separated into year, month, day, and so on. Broken-down time values are not useful for calculations, but they are useful for printing human-readable time information. A broken-down time value is always relative to a choice of time zone.

```c
struct tm {
    int tm_sec; // seconds [0..60]
    int tm_min; // minutes [0..59]
    int tm_hour; // hours [0..23]
    int tm_mday; // day of the month [1..31]
    int tm_mon; // month [0..11]
    int tm_year; // years since 1900
    int tm_wday; // weekday [0..6], Sunday = 0
    int tm_yday; // day of year [0..365]
    int tm_isdst; // daylight saving time flag
}
```

With `struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *t);` you can convert a time_t to a broken-down time in UTC. Or you can use `struct tm *localtime(const time_t *t);` to convert a time_t to a broken-down time in local time.

With `time_t mktime(struct tm *timeptr);` you can convert broken-down time into time_t since the Epoch. tm_wday and tm_yday components of the structure are ignored

### Time and Strings

When not computing we want times to be in a human-readable form which is why there are lots of functions to convert times to strings:

- `char *ctime(const time_t *timep);` returns a 26-byte string representing the time in locale and DST: "Wed Jun 8 14:22:34 2011".
- `char *asctime(const struct tm *t);` does the same as `ctime()` without changing the timezone or DST.

Often we also want to be able to format the string for this we can use `size_t strftime(char *restrict s, size_t max, const char *restrict format, const struct tm *restrict tm);` which formats the time and stores it in s. For example, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" becomes "2018-12-29T12:17:25Z" where Z is only if UTC.

There are also cases for example when getting input from users we want to parse a string to a time for this we can use `char *strptime(const char *restrict s, const char *restrict format, struct tm *restrict tm);` which parses the string s using the format to the time and stores it in tm.

Some key formats being:

| Format                 | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| %a / %A                | abbreviated / full weekday name         |
| %b / %B                | abbreviated / full month name           |
| %d / %m / %w / %W / %u | day / month / weekday / week as decimal |
| %y / %y                | year with or without century            |
| %H / %M / %S           | hour / minute / second as decimal       |

### Timezones

Timezones define the time and region of a program. Timezones are stored in the environment variable `TZ` for Unix systems. To find out urs you can type:

With the `void tzset(void);` you can initialize the timezone which in turn sets the following global variables:

- `extern char *tzname[2];` zone and DST zone.
- `extern long timezone;` difference to UTC in seconds.
- `extern int daylight;` non-null if DST.

## Process Time

Process time is the cpu time that a process has used since creation. It consists of two parts: User CPU time which is the amount of time spent in user mode, also commonly referred to as virtual time. And System cpu time which is the amount of time spent in kernel mode whilst doing for example system calls.

`clock_t times(struct tms *t);` returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since an arbitrary point in the past and stores the current process times in the parameter.
`clock_t clock(void);` returns an approximation of processor time used so far by the program.

```c
struct tms {
    clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
    clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
    clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
    clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
};
```

```c
#include <time.h>
#include <sys/times.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    long tckPerSec = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
    long clockPerSec = CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Ticks per second: %ld\n", tckPerSec);
    printf("Clocks per second: %ld\n", clockPerSec);
    struct tms sinceStart;
    sleep(10);
    clock_t clock = times(&sinceStart);
    printf("Since start: User(%ld), System(%ld)\n", sinceStart.tms_utime, sinceStart.tms_stime);
    printf("%ld", clock/clockPerSec);
    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/times.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    struct tms t0_buf;
    clock_t t0 = times(&t0_buf);
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        execvp(argv[1], argv + 1); // does not return
    }
    fflush(stdout);
    wait(NULL); // wait for child to exit
    struct tms t1_buf;
    clock_t t1 = times(&t1_buf);

    long ticks_per_s = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
    printf("\nreal \t%ld\nuser \t%lfs\nsys \t%lfs\n",
        (t1 - t0) / ticks_per_s,
        (t1_buf.tms_cutime - t0_buf.tms_cutime) / (double) ticks_per_s,
        (t1_buf.tms_cstime - t0_buf.tms_cstime) / (double) ticks_per_s);
    return 0;
}
```

### Unix Timers and Sleeping

With a timer, you can send notifications to a process after a certain time. Sleeping suspends the process or thread for a given time.

#### Interval Timer

With `int setitimer(int which, const struct itimerval *restrict new_value, struct itimerval *restrict old_value);` that notifies in regular intervals. You can use the following which values:

- `ITIMER_REAL` counts down in real-time and sends a SIGALRM signal.
- `ITIMER_VIRTUAL` counts down in user CPU time and sends a SIGVTALRM signal.
- `ITIMER_PROF` counts down in system CPU time and sends a SIGPROF signal. Can be used together with the one above.

```c
 struct itimerval {
    struct timeval it_interval; /* Interval for periodic timer */
    struct timeval it_value;    /* Time until next notification */
};

struct timeval {
    time_t      tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    suseconds_t tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
};
```

You can check the remaining time with `int getitimer(int which, struct itimerval *curr_value);`.

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/time.h>

void timer_handler(int signum)
{
    static int count = 0;
    printf("timer expired %d times\n", ++count);
}

int main()
{
    struct itimerval timer;
    signal(SIGVTALRM, timer_handler);

    /* Configure the timer to expire after 250 msec... */
    timer.it_value.tv_sec = 0;
    timer.it_value.tv_usec = 250000;
    /* ... and every 250 msec after that. */
    timer.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;
    timer.it_interval.tv_usec = 250000;
    /* Start a virtual timer. It counts down whenever this process is
      executing. */
    setitimer(ITIMER_VIRTUAL, &timer, NULL);

    /* Do busy work. */
    while (1)
        ;
}
```

#### One-time Timer - Alarm

With `unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);` you can set up a one-time occurring timer. When the timer expires the `SIGALRM` signal is sent. An existing timer can be removed with `alarm(0);`

#### Timer Precision

Depending on CPU use the process might only start just after being notified. This however does not influence the next signal (no delaying).

#### Suspend Processes - Sleeping

You can suspend a process with `unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);`. Internally it is implemented with `int nanosleep(const struct timespec *req, struct timespec *rem);`.
