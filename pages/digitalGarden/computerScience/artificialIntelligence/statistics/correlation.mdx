# Correlation

Correlation is a statistical measure that describes how related two random variables are, for computer scientists, this
is usually how related two vectors or time series are.

## Correlation Coefficients

Most often the correlation coefficient is defined as $\rho$ (rho) or $r$ and is a value between -1 and 1, i.e.
$-1 \leq \rho \leq 1$. The simplest form of correlation is a linear correlation, which is a linear relationship between
the two variables. The correlation coefficient can then be interpreted in the following way:

- $\rho = 1$ means that the two variables are perfectly correlated, i.e. if one variable increases, the other variable
    increases as well.
- $\rho = -1$ means that the two variables are perfectly negatively correlated, i.e. if one variable increases, the
    other variable decreases.
- $\rho = 0$ means that the two variables are not correlated at all, i.e. if one variable increases or decreases, the
    other variable does not change.

Therefore, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient can be interpreted as the strength of the correlation.

<Callout type="example">
    A simple example of a linear correlation is the air temperature and the number of ice creams sold. If it is hot
    then more ice creams are sold, if it is cold then less ice creams are sold. This is a linear correlation, and the
    correlation coefficient is close to 1 as the two variables increase and decrease together.

<Callout type="warning">
    The correlation coefficient only measures if there is a correlation between the two variables, it does not say
    anything about cause and effect. For example if we have a positive correlation between the number of ice creams
    sold and the number of people who drown, it does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to drown. It is
    simply that both variables increase during the summer months.

### Outliers

The correlation coefficient is just like regression sensitive to outliers. If there are outliers in the data, then
the correlation coefficient will be affected by them. So it is important to check for outliers before calculating the
correlation coefficient.
