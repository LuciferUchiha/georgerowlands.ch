## Of Vectors

For Deep learning.

Is just cross-correlation. Dot product of the 2 vectors after flattening the matrix. Theorectically the one vector should be flipped upside down for 
it to not be a cross-correlation but nobody cares.

This is associtiave in regards to applying filters? Where as cross-correlation isnt?

## Of Functions

For Signal processing.

of 2 functions is then another function where one of them is flipped on y axis and then slowly slid along the x axis over the other function.
Should probably both be scaled to the same units then can interpret it better? But If resulting funciton is same as an input then the two inputs 
are the same??? How to interpret cross correlation.

# Cross Correlation

## Of Vectors

See above.

## Of Functions

Same but the function isnt flipped.

## Of Time Series

How is this interpretetd. Should say somethign about lags no?

# Auto Correlation

Is Cross Correlation but the two functions are the same so a cross correlation with itself. How is this interpretetd? Same goes here for time series is this interpreted?

## Partial Auto Correltion
