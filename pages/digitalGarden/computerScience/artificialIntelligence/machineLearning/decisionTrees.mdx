# Decision Trees

Trees with decision nodes and leaf nodes. Decision nodes ask a question and split the data based on the answer. 
Leaf nodes are the final nodes that predict the outcome. 

## Classification Trees

Can be used for classification, i.e. in the leaves we have the class labels.

## Regression Trees

Can be used for regression, i.e. in the leaves we then get a prediction of the target variable.

## Pruning a Tree

Pruning is a technique to reduce the size of the tree by removing nodes that do not provide much information.

## Problems with Decision Trees

They can overfit the data. They are sensitive to small changes in the data. They can create biased trees if some classes dominate. 
They can't handle unseen data well.
