# Common Problems

## Undo Unstaged Local Changes

To overwrite local changes:

```bash
git checkout -- <file>
```

To discard local changes to all files, permanently:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

## Undo Staged Local Changes

To unstage the file but keep your changes:

```bash
git restore --staged <file>
```

To unstage everything but keep your changes:

```bash
git reset
```

To discard local changes to all files, permanently:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

## Undo Committed Local Changes

This is a always a bit harder...
To undo last two commits, but keep your changes:

```bash
git reset HEAD~2
```

To undo last two commits, discard changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

## Change Commit

To change the message of the last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New message"
```

Did you forget to add a file? Just add it and amend the previous commit :)

```bash
git add forgotten_file
git commit --amend
```
