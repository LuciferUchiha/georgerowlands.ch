# General Definition

A Graph is one of the most fundamental but also diverse data structures in computer science. A Graph consists of a set
of vertices and a set of edges which connects pairs of vertices. They are used to represent relationships between
various entities or elements (the vertices) by connecting with edges.

For example, a graph can be used to represent a social network where the vertices are people and the edges are whether
they are friends with each other.

export const simpleGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "Node 1", title: "node 1 tootip text"},
        {id: 2, label: "Node 2", title: "node 2 tootip text"},
        {id: 3, label: "Node 3", title: "node 3 tootip text"},
        {id: 4, label: "Node 4", title: "node 4 tootip text"},
        {id: 5, label: "Node 5", title: "node 5 tootip text"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 1, to: 3},
        {from: 2, to: 4},
        {from: 2, to: 5}
    ]
};
