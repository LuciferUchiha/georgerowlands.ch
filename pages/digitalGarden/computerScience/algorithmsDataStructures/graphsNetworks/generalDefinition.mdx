# General Definition

A Graph is one of the most fundamental but also diverse data structures in computer science. A Graph consists of a set
of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$ where each edge is an unordered pair. Hence, $G=(V,E)$. They are used to
represent relationships between various entities or elements (the vertices) by connecting with edges.

For example, a graph can be used to represent a social network where the vertices are people and the edges are whether
they are friends with each other. In the below graph $G=(V,E)$ where:

- $V=\{\text{Bob, Alice, Michael, Urs, Karen}\}$ and
- $E=\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5)\}$

export const friendsGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "Bob"},
        {id: 2, label: "Alice"},
        {id: 3, label: "Michael"},
        {id: 4, label: "Urs"},
        {id: 5, label: "Karen"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 1, to: 3},
        {from: 2, to: 4},
        {from: 2, to: 5}
    ]
};

## Graphs of Functions

You might be more familiar with Graphs when talking about mathematical functions. In mathematics, a Graph of a Function
is a visual representation of the relationship between the input values (domain) and their corresponding output values
(range) under a specific function.

Formally, a Graph of a Function can be defined as follows:

Let $f$ be a function defined on a set of input values, called the domain $D$, and taking values in a set of output
values, called the range $R$. The Graph of the Function $f$, denoted as $G(f)$, is a mathematical representation
consisting of a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x \in D$ and $y = f(x)$. Each ordered pair represents a point on
the graph, with $x$ as the independent variable (input) and $y$ as the dependent variable (output).


In other words, the Graph of a Function is a visual representation of how the elements in the domain are mapped to
the corresponding elements in the range through the function $f$.

For example, consider the following function:

$$
f(x) = 2x + 1
$$

Its domain could be the set of all real numbers $\Bbb{R}$, and its range could also be $\Bbb{R}$. To represent this
function graphically, we plot points on the Cartesian plane where the $x$-coordinate corresponds to the input value,
and the $y$-coordinate is the output value obtained by evaluating $f(x)$.

Graphs of Functions play a crucial role in analyzing and understanding the behavior of functions and studying their
overall patterns and trends.

## Types of Graphs

### Complete Graphs

A complete graph is a graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex, very simple. In other words, a
complete graph contains all possible edges. A complete graph with $n$ vertices is denoted as $K_n$.

For example, the below graph is a complete graph with 5 vertices, $K_5$.

### Directed Graphs

A Directed Graph is a graph where each edge is directed from one vertex to another. In other words, the edges have a
direction. The previous graph was an example of an undirected graph as we would hope that if person A thinks of person B
as a friend then Person B feels the same way. However, in a directed graph, this is not necessarily the case.

So we can define a directed graph as $G=(V,A)$ where:

- V is again the set of vertices
- A is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs, arrows or directed edges (sometimes simply edges with the
corresponding set named E instead of A). Ordered pairs are used here because (unlike for undirected graphs) the
direction of an edge $(u,v)$ is important: $(u,v)$ is not the same edge as $(v,u)$. The first vertex is called the
tail or initial vertex and the second vertex is called the head or terminal vertex.

For example, let us imagine a directed graph where the vertices are the same as the previous example but the edges
signify if a person has liked another person's post on social media. We then get the below graph $G=(V,A)$ where:

- $V=\{\text{Bob, Alice, Michael, Urs, Karen}\}$ and
- $A=\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5),(5,2)\}$


export const postLikedGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "Bob"},
        {id: 2, label: "Alice"},
        {id: 3, label: "Michael"},
        {id: 4, label: "Urs"},
        {id: 5, label: "Karen"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 1, to: 3},
        {from: 2, to: 4},
        {from: 2, to: 5},
        {from: 5, to: 2}
    ]
};

<Graph
    graph={postLikedGraph}
    directed={true}
/>

### Weighted Graphs

A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a weight (a number associated with it). It can be as a triple
$G = (E, V, w)$ where $w$ is a function that maps edges or directed edges to their weights. So, $w: E \rightarrow \Bbb{R}$
could be a function for a graph with real numbers as weights.

For example, in a graph where each city is a vertex and each edge is a road between two cities, the weight could
be the distance in km between them.

export const cityGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "London"},
        {id: 2, label: "Paris"},
        {id: 3, label: "Berlin"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2, value: 343, label: "343", length: 200},
        {from: 1, to: 3, value: 933, label: "933", length: 400},
        {from: 2, to: 3, value: 878, label: "878", length: 300},
    ]
}

<Graph
    graph={cityGraph}
    options={
        {
            layout: {
                randomSeed: 1
            },
        }
    }
/>

### Networks vs Graphs

The only real difference between a network and a graph is the terminology. A network is a graph with a real-world context.
For example, a social network is a graph with a real-world context. A graph is a mathematical structure that represents
relationships between objects. When talking about a network we also tend to talk about nodes and links instead of
vertices and edges.

| Graphs | Networks |
|--------|----------|
| Vertices | Nodes |
| Edges | Links |

### Trees

A tree is a special type of graph where there is only one path between any two vertices. This means that there are no
cycles in a tree. Trees are used in many different algorithms and data structures such as binary search trees. You can
read more about trees in the [Trees](../trees/generalDefinition) section.


### Cycle/Circular Graphs

A cycle or circular graph is a graph with exactly one cycle. Where a cycle is non-empty path in which only the first and
last vertices are equal, i.e a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. You can think of it as a closed chain.

A path/trail/walk in a graph is defined as being a sequence of vertices, where consecutive vertices in the sequence are
connected by an edge.

Commonly a cycle with length $n$ is called an $n$-cycle and is denoted as $C_n$.

For example, the below graph is a circular graph as it has only one cycle with the following path:

$$
P = (a,b,c,a)
$$

export const cycleGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "a"},
        {id: 2, label: "b"},
        {id: 3, label: "c"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 2, to: 3},
        {from: 3, to: 1},
    ]
}

<Graph
    graph={cycleGraph}

### Signed Graphs

A signed graph is a graph in which each edge has a positive or negative sign. They can be used to represent a
relationship between two vertices. For example, a positive sign could mean that two people are allies and a negative
sign could mean that they are enemies.

#### Triads and Balance Theory

Triads are a set of three vertices in a signed graph where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge, i.e forming a
triangle. Triads are important in social network analysis as they can be used to determine the stability of a social
network.

The balance theory states that a social network is balanced if all triads within that network are balanced. For a triad
to be balanced, the number of negative edges must be even (0 being even). This leads to the following four possible
triads:

![balancedTriads](/compSci/balancedTriads.png)

The first and last one are the simplest as they are either all positive or all negative. The idea of the second one
is that it is balanced because "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". The third one is a common scenario that leads to
issues in social networks. For example, if Alice and Eve are allies and Bob and Eve are alies but Alice and
Bob are enemies, then this leads to issues in the social network if Eve wants to introduce Alice and Bob to each other.

#### Balanced Signed Graphs

From the above, we can see that a signed graph is balanced if all triads are balanced. Where a triade could also be
defined as a cycle of length 3, $C_3$.
