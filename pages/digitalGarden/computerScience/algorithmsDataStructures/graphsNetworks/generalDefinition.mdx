# General Definition

A Graph is one of the most fundamental but also diverse data structures in computer science. A Graph consists of a set
of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. Hence, $G=(V,E)$. They are used to represent relationships between various entities or elements
(the vertices) by connecting with edges.

For example, a graph can be used to represent a social network where the vertices are people and the edges are whether
they are friends with each other. In the below graph $G=(V,E)$ where:

- $V=\{\text{Bob, Alice, Michael, Urs, Karen}\}$ and
- $E=\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5)\}$

export const simpleGraph = {
    nodes: [
        {id: 1, label: "Bob"},
        {id: 2, label: "Alice"},
        {id: 3, label: "Michael"},
        {id: 4, label: "Urs"},
        {id: 5, label: "Karen"}
    ],
    edges: [
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 1, to: 3},
        {from: 2, to: 4},
        {from: 2, to: 5}
    ]
};

    graph={simpleGraph}

## Graphs of Functions

You might be more familiar with Graphs when talking about mathematical functions. In mathematics, a Graph of a Function
is a visual representation of the relationship between the input values (domain) and their corresponding output values
(range) under a specific function.

Formally, a Graph of a Function can be defined as follows:

Let $f$ be a function defined on a set of input values, called the domain $D$, and taking values in a set of output
values, called the range $R$. The Graph of the Function $f$, denoted as $G(f)$, is a mathematical representation
consisting of a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x \in D$ and $y = f(x)$. Each ordered pair represents a point on
the graph, with $x$ as the independent variable (input) and $y$ as the dependent variable (output).


In other words, the Graph of a Function is a visual representation of how the elements in the domain are mapped to
the corresponding elements in the range through the function $f$.

For example, consider the following function:

$$
f(x) = 2x + 1
$$

Its domain could be the set of all real numbers $\Bbb{R}$, and its range could also be $\Bbb{R}$. To represent this
function graphically, we plot points on the Cartesian plane where the $x$-coordinate corresponds to the input value,
and the $y$-coordinate is the output value obtained by evaluating $f(x)$. By connecting these points, we get a straight
line, which is the Graph of the Function $f(x) = 2x + 1$.

Graphs of Functions play a crucial role in analyzing and understanding the behavior of functions and studying their
overall patterns and trends.
