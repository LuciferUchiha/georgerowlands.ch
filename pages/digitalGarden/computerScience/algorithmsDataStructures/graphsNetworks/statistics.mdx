## Hypothesis Testing

null hypothesis H0 (no statstical relationship between variables) vs alternative hypothesis H1 (there is a statistical relationship between variables)

alpha level (significance level) - probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, usually 0.05 5%
which means that in 5% of there is a relationship even though we say there is not.

when working with networks we use permutation tests to test our hypothesis because other tests assume that the data is independent
and in networks the data is not independent for obvious reasons.

## Permutation Tests

In a permutation test you start with the initial state of the network and then randomly permute the
network and then calculate the statistic of interest and then repeat this process many times and then
compare the statistic of interest to the distribution of the permuted statistics.


The p-value is then the probability of observing a statistic as extreme as the one observed given the null hypothesis is true.

Example

### Monadic Tests

on vertex attributes, for example as hypothesis rich people are well connected (high degree centrality).

example

counting part

### Dyadic Tests

different relationship for same vertices so correlation between different networks but of the same vertices.

### Mixed Tests

test for relationship between vertex attributes and network structure. for example if people of the same gender
communicate mor often with each other then people of different genders. Or if the age has an impact on how people
communicate.

Reduced down to dyadic tests. connect all people of same gender. or connect all nodes and have edge value of absolute
age difference.
