## Vertex Centrality

Vertex centrality measures can be used to determine the importance of a vertex in a graph. There are many different
vertex centrality measures, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In a communication network a vertex with
high centrality is an actor that is important for the communication in the network, hence they are also often called
actor centrality measures. An actor with high centrality can control the flow of information in the network for good or
bad. They can also be used to determine key actors in a network, for example in a power grid it is important to know
which vertices are key actors, because if they fail, the whole network fails.

### Degree Centrality

The degree centrality is the simplest centrality measure. It is simply the number of edges connected to a vertex. The
degree centrality is a local measure, because it only takes into account the direct neighbors of a vertex. It can be
calculated using the $\text{deg()}$ function. Or alternatively using the $\text{indeg()}$ and $\text{outdeg()}$
depending on whether the graph is directed or not and the use-case.

</Callout>

The degree centrality can be normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible degree in the graph. This is rarely done
in practice, because a lot of values will be small, and we are most often interested in the actual degree of a vertex.

The interpretation of the degree centrality is pretty self-explanatory. And is closely related to the
[prestige](#prestige) of a vertex.

### Closeness Centrality

Unlucky the degree centrality, the closeness centrality is a global measure, because it takes into account the whole
graph, however the consequence of this is that it is more expensive to calculate. The idea of the closeness centrality
is that a vertex is important if it is close to the center of the graph. So a vertex can be important as long as it is
close to the center of the graph, even if it only has one edge. As seen by the green vertex in the following graph.

The closeness centrality for a vertex $v$ is calculated by taking the inverse distance of all shortest paths from the
vertex $v$ to all other vertices in the graph. This can be interpreted as how efficiently can all the other vertices
be reached from $v$. The formula for the closeness centrality is as follows:

$$
\text{closenessCentrality}(v) = \sum_{u \in V \setminus \{v\}}{d(v,u)^{-1}} = \sum_{u \in V \setminus \{v\}}{\frac{1}{d(v,u)}}
$$

Where $d(v,u)$ is the length of the shortest path from $v$ to $u$.

To normalize the closeness centrality, it can be divided by $|V| - 1$.

### Betweenness Centrality

If we use the degree centrality on the below graph, we can see that the green ones are the most important. However,
we can clearly visually see that the vertex inbetween them is the most important one as it connects the two communities.
Because of this we could say that that vertex is in Brokerage position or is a Broker/Gatekeeper of information.

The betweenness centrality is a global measure that takes into account the whole graph and tries to solve the above
issue. The idea of the betweenness centrality is that a vertex is important if a lot of shortest paths go through it.

To calculate the betweenness centrality we need to calculate the number of shortest paths that go through a vertex $v$.
So for every pair of vertices $u$ and $w$ we need to calculate the shortest paths and then count how many of them go
through $v$. The formula for the betweenness centrality is as follows:

$$
\text{betweennessCentrality}(v) = \sum_{u \neq v \neq w}{\frac{\sigma_{uw}(v)}{\sigma_{uw}}}
$$

Where $\sigma_{uw}$ is the number of shortest paths from $u$ to $w$ and $\sigma_{uw}(v)$ is the number of shortest paths
from $u$ to $w$ that go through $v$.

<Callout type="info">
The fraction in the formula leads to the weight being split if there are multiple shortest paths between $u$ and $w$.

### Prestige

In a directed Graph it is possible to analyze the prestige of a vertex, i.e the stature or reputation associated with
a vertex. The vertices relationships however need to resemble this. For example, if a person has a lot of followers
but doesn't follow a lot of people, then that person has a high prestige and stature, for example a celebrity.

#### Popularity

The simplest way to measure prestige is to count the number of incoming edges, i.e using the $\text{indeg()}$ function.
This is called popularity.

#### Proximity Prestige

The proximity prestige measure does not just account for the number of directly incoming edges, but also the number of
indirectly incoming edges, i.e the number of paths that lead to the vertex. However, the longer the path, the lower
prestige from that path is weighted.

So simply put the proximity prestige is the sum of all paths that lead to the vertex weighted by the length of the path.

The formula for the proximity prestige can be summarized pretty simply:

> The proximity prestige of a vertex is the number of vertices that have a path to the vertex divided by the average
path length leading to the vertex.

More formally:

$$
\text{proximityPrestige}(v) = \frac{\frac{|I|}{n-1}}{\frac{\sum_{i \in I}{d(i,v)}}{|I|}}
$$

Where $I$ is the set of all vertices that have a path to $v$ and $d(u,v)$ is the length of the shortest path from $u$ to
$v$.

## Group Centrality

The goal of group centrality measures is to determine the importance of a group of vertices in a graph. These measures
are based on the vertex centrality measures, but they are more complex and expensive to calculate.

### Degree Group Centrality

The degree group centrality is the simplest group centrality measure. It is simply the fraction of the number of
vertices outside the group that are directly connected to the group. So in the following graph with the group $G$ being
defined as $G={v_6,v_7,v_8}$ the degree group centrality would be $\frac{3}{10}$ so $0.3$.
