Often times when working with big networks such as social networks there is too much data to be able to visualize it all
at once or analyze. To make it easier to work with the data, we can either create a specific view of the data like when
working with database tables, or we can use sampling to take samples of the data.

## Views

### Local View

### Global View

### Context View

### Ego View

Ego/node/focus view is a view of the network that is centered around a specific node.

## Sampling

Sampling is the process of taking a subset of the data and working with that instead of the entire network.
