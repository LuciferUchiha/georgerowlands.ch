Often times when working with big networks such as social networks there is too much data to be able to visualize it all
at once or analyze. To make it easier to work with the data, we can either create a specific view of the data like when
working with database tables, or we can use sampling to take samples of the data.

    Visualize the different views

## Views

### Local View

The local view focuses on a specific group of nodes and their connections. So the local view is a subset of the entire
network that has been selected based on some criteria. For example if we have a network of people in a company, we can
create a local view of the network that only contains people that are in the same department to analyze how they
communicate with each other.

### Global View

The global view allows for a general view of the entire network. Here we summarize nodes to a single node based on some
criteria. For example if we have a network of people in a company, we can create a global view of the network that
summarizes all the people in the same department to a single node. This allows us to see how the different departments
communicate with each other.

### Context View

The context view is a combination of the local and global view. First we summarize the network to a global view. Then
we pick a node in the global view and expand it again. If we have our previous example of a network of people in a
company, we can create a context view of the network that summarizes all the people in the same department to a single
node. Then we pick a department and expand it again to see how the people in that department communicate with the other
departments.

### Ego View

Ego/node/focus view is a view of the network that is centered around a specific node. In this view, the selected node
is the "ego," and its immediate connections, i.e. its neighbours are analyzed.

## Sampling

Sampling is the process of taking a subset of the data and working with that instead of the entire network.
