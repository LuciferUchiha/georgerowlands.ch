Communities are subgraphs (subsets or groups of vertices of the original graph), that are better connected to each
other than to the rest of the graph. Communities are very important when analyzing social networks and networks in
general as they often form around a context or a topic such as family, friends, work, hobbies, etc.

These communities can then be further analyzed such as to find out who are the most important people in a community,
what is there impact on the community, and how do they relate to other communities.

## Connected Components

Of all the communities, the most basic one with the simplest definition is the connected component. If a connected
component includes a large portion of the graph, then it is commonly referred to as the giant component.

### Undirected Graphs

In an undirected graph, a connected component is a subset of vertices such that there is a path between every pair of
vertices in the subset. In other words, a connected component is a subgraph of the original graph where all vertices
are connected to each other.

This could be useful for example to find out if a graph is fully connected or not. If the graph has only one connected
component, then it is fully connected. If it has more than one connected component, then it is not fully connected.

If we think of a communication network, then a connected component would be a group of people that can communicate with
each other. If there are multiple connected components, then there are groups of people that cannot communicate with
each other.

### Directed Graphs

In a directed graph the directions of the edges matter. This gives us two types of connected components, weakly
connected components and strongly connected components.

#### Weakly Connected Components

Weakly connected components are the same as connected components in an undirected graphs. So you just ignore the
directions of the edges.

![weaklyConnectedComponents](/compSci/weaklyConnectedComponents.png)

#### Strongly Connected Components

Strongly connected components are a bit more complex. In a directed graph, a strongly connected component is a subset of
vertices such that there is a path between every pair of vertices in the subset, but the path must follow the direction
of the edges.

## Cliques

Cliques focus on undirected graphs. A clique is a complete subgraph of the original graph, i.e a subgraph where all
vertices are connected to each other. Cliques are very important in social networks as they represent groups of people
that all know each other, however in a communication network they would represent a group with redundant connections.

Because cliques are complete subgraphs, they are very easy to find but also happen to be very rare. In the graph below
the two cliques have been highlighted in red and blue.

### k-Core

For a k-Core the rules of a clique are slightly relaxed. A k-Core is a subgraph where all vertices are at least connected
to $k$ other vertices in the subgraph.

<Callout type="todo">
    Visualization of k-Core
</Callout>

Although this is a relaxation of the rules, it is still a very strict rule and
can lead to vertices that don't fulfill the $k$ connections but are only connected to other vertices in a core to not
be included in the core.

    Show the issue + maybe algorithm to find k-Core

    Degeneracy of a graph and k-degenerate graphs is exactly this
</Callout>

### p-Clique

The idea of a p-clique is also to relax the rules of a clique whilst also solving the above-mentioned issue of the
k-core. In a p-clique, the p stands for a percentage in decimal i.e. a ratio. So in a p-clique at least the given
percentage of vertices must be connected to other vertices in the subgraph.

So if we have a 0.5-clique, then at least 50% of the vertices must be connected to other vertices in the subgraph. This
then allows for the vertices that don't fulfill the rule to be included in the subgraph for a k-core but are only
connected to other vertices in the subgraph to be included in the subgraph.

### n-Clique

<Callout type="warning">
    Sometimes cliques are named after the number of vertices they contain. For example a clique with 3 vertices is
    called a 3-clique, a clique with 4 vertices is called a 4-clique, etc. this can be generalized to a k-clique. Not an
    n-clique though, that is something else, but when it just says 4-clique it can be ambiguous.
</Callout>

The idea of an n-clique is that we want a maximal subgraph, i.e. with the most vertices, where each pair of vertices can
be connected by a path of length at most n. So a 1-clique is just a normal clique, a 2-clique is a clique where each
pair of vertices can be connected by a path of length at most 2, etc.

<Callout type="warning">
    The path doesn't have to be the shortest path, just a path of length at most n. And the path can go over any vertex,
    not just vertices that are part of the clique.
</Callout>

This can lead to two interesting scenarios:

1. The diameter of the subgraph can actually be longer then n. This is due to the path being able to go over any vertex,
not just vertices that are part of the clique. So in the example below, the diameter of the subgraph is 3 even though it
is a 2-clique.

![nCliqueDiameter](/compSci/nCliqueDiameter.png)

2. The subgraph can be disconnected. In the example below you can see two possible 2-cliques of many for the given graph.
Interestingly, they are both disconnected, because if one of the vertices inbetween is included, then a different vertex
can no longer be included.
