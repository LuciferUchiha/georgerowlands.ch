Graph connectivity is also known as graph resilience and is a measure of how well a graph can maintain its connectivity
when vertices or edges are removed, i.e how many vertices or edges can be removed before the graph becomes disconnected
(from one connected component to multiple connected components) or has a higher number of connected components.

With this analysis technique we can find out how robust a graph is, i.e. how well it can handle failures which can be
very useful in real world applications such as communication, transportation, etc.

## Bridges

A Bridge is an edge that if removed would increase the number of connected components in the graph. In the graph below
you can quiet clearly see that the edge between vertices x and y is a bridge.

## Cut Vertices

The same idea as a bridge also applies to vertices. A vertex is a cut vertex if removing it would increase the number
of connected components in the graph. In the graph below you can quiet clearly see that the vertex x is a cut vertex.
These cut vertices are very important vertices as they are brokers between different parts of the graph.

## k-Connected Graphs

### k-Vertex-Connected Graphs

A graph is $k$-vertex-connected if it has at least $k+1$ vertices and at least $k$ vertices have to be removed to disconnect
the graph.

The vertex connectivity of a graph $G$ is the largest $k$ such that $G$ is $k$-vertex-connected. So for example the graph
below has a vertex connectivity of 2, because it is 2-vertex-connected, but not 3-vertex-connected.

### k-Edge-Connected Graphs

The same idea as for vertex connectivity also applies to edge connectivity. A graph is $k$-edge-connected if it has at
least $k+1$ vertices and at least $k$ edges have to be removed to disconnect the graph.
