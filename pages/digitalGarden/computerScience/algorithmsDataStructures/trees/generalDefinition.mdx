# General Definition

Trees have **nodes** that hold the data and **edges** which connect the nodes. An **empty tree** obviously has no nodes and therefore no data.

## Characteristics

A Tree like in our real world has a root. The **root** is the highest node in the tree. Each node is also a root of its own **subtree**. A **child** node is a node that is connected to a node above it, the so called **parent**. A **Sibling** is a node that shares the same parent. A **leaf** node has no children as it is hanging alone at the bottom of a subtree. An **inner node** however has at least 1 child.

## Order

The **Order of a tree** is the max amount of children a tree is aloud to have. In the above picture we don't know the order of the tree but we can say that it is $\geq 3$.

## Degree

The **degree of a node** is the amount of children a specific node has. Often this is denoted as *deg(v)=Number of children of node*. So in the above tree *deg(Q)=2*.

## Path

A **path** is a combination of edges between 2 Nodes. The length of the path is the amount of nodes visited whilst traversing from the start node to the end node. The amount includes the start and the end node. So in the above tree the length of the path from R to H is 4.

## Height

The **height of a tree** is the length of  the longest path from the root to a leaf. In the above tree the height is 5.

## Depth

The **depth of a node** is the amount of nodes on the path to the root. Often this is denoted as *depth(v)=Number of nodes on path to root*. So in the above tree *depth(L)=4*.

## Level

A **Level** is a grouping of all nodes with the same depth.

## Properties

A **Full tree** is a tree where all inner nodes have the maximum amount of Nodes according to the order. In the image below both trees are full with an order of 2.

A **Complete tree** is a tree where each level has the maximum amount of nodes according to the order. In the image below only the left tree is complete with an order of 2.
