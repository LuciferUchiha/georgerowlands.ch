# Stacks

A stack is as the name says like a stack of paper. Meaning it follows the LIFO policy (last in first out). The most common operations on queues are:

- `push(E e)`: Puts the element onto the top of the stack.
- `E pop()`: Takes the element from the top of the stack.
- `E peek()`: Returns the element at the top of the stack, which corresponds to the element to next be popped.

### Stack Using two Queues

Although the most common way of implementing a stack is with a [linked list](./linkedLists) it is also possible to implement a stack by using two queues. Just like when [implementing a queue with two stacks](./queues#queue-using-two-stacks) you need to decide if adding or removing an element will be expensive.
