# Insertion Sort

The insertion sort algorithm is a bit more complex than the bubble sort or selection sort but still relatively simple.
You can think of it in the following way:

Imagine you have a deck of cards, and you want to sort them in ascending order.
You assume that the first card is already sorted. Then, you take the second card and compare it to the first card, if
it is smaller, you place it in front of it. Now the first two cards are sorted. Then, you take the third card and
compare it to the ones before it, one after another until you find the right place to insert it, hence the name
insertion sort as you repeatedly insert cards into the sorted part of the deck. This way the sorted part of the array slowly grows from left to right.

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        # Compare key with each element to the left of it until a smaller one is found
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```
