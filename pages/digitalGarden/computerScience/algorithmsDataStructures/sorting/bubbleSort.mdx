# Bubble Sort

When starting to study algorithms and data structures, the first algorithm that is usually taught is the Bubble Sort.
It is a simple sorting algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. However, it is not very efficient and is not
used in practice.

The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping neighboring elements if they are in the wrong order, i.e. if we are sorting
an array of numbers in ascending order we check if the current number is greater than the next number, if so we swap
them, if not we go to the next. The algorithm is called Bubble Sort because with each iteration the largest element in
the array "bubbles up" to the end of the array due to this swapping.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```

From the code above we can see that the algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$ as
it works in place.

The above implementation can be slightly by considering the fact that after each iteration the largest element at the
end of the array is already in the correct position, so we can reduce the number of iterations by 1 each time.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr) - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```
